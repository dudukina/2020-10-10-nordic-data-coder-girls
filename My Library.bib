	abstract = {Medication use patterns provide popular surrogate measures of disease, yet selective under-use of drugs by elderly patients with potentially unmeasured comorbidity may lead to artifactual "protective" associations between use of specific drugs and mortality. We examined the relation between use of 20 common classes of drugs and mortality among the 129,111 residents of New Jersey 65-99 years of age who had at least one hospitalization during the years 1991-1994 and filled prescriptions through either Medicaid or that state's Pharmacy Assistance for the Aged and Disabled program. Each study drug class was used by more than 5,000 subjects during the 120 days before hospitalization; 41,930 subjects died in the hospital or during the year after discharge. Users of drugs from each of seven therapeutic classes had reduced age- and sex-adjusted rates of death relative to non-users: lipid-lowering agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, beta blockers, thiazides, glaucoma drugs, calcium channel blockers, and anti-anxiety drugs. Adjustment for comorbidity and polypharmacy had little effect on these results. We found similar results in a separate nonhospitalized cohort of 132,071 elderly persons. Much of this observed association appears to be nonetiologic. These findings raise concerns about using observational studies in high-risk populations to infer associations between drug use and outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background: Recent retrospective studies suggest that beta-adrenergic blocking drugs (BB) are associated with improved outcomes in patients with a range of cancers. Although limited and discordant data suggest that BB may increase overall survival (OS) in localized breast cancer (BC), there is no information on the effects of BB in women with advanced BC. Patients and methods: To explore the association between BB use and BC outcomes, we retrospectively reviewed ROSE/TRIO-012, a double-blinded, multinational phase III trial that randomized 1144 patients with HER2-negative advanced BC to first-line docetaxel in combination with ramucirumab or placebo. We compared progression-free survival (PFS), OS, overall response rate, and clinical benefit rate in patients who received BB to those who did not. Results: 153/1144 (13\%) patients received BB; 62\% prior to enrolment and 38\% began after enrolment. Median PFS in BB treated patients was longer than in patients who did not receive them (10.3 versus 8.3 months; HR 0.81; 95\% CI 0.66-0.99; P = 0.038). Patients treated with BB only after enrolment had even higher median PFS (15.5 versus 8.3 months, P {\textless} 0.001). In the TNBC subset, median PFS was 13.0 months with BB, compared to 5.2 months without BB (HR 0.52; 95\% CI 0.34-0.79; P = 0.002). The benefit of BB intake in PFS was independent of treatment-emergent hypertension (P = 0.476) but associated with treatment arm (P = 0.037). The test for interactions between BB and treatment arm was not significant (P = 0.276). No differences were seen in OS, overall response rate, or clinical benefit rate. A validation dataset analysis had consistent but less substantial improved outcomes for women with node positive operable breast cancer receiving BB in the BCIRG-005 trial. Conclusions: In this exploratory analysis, BB intake was associated with significant improvement in PFS, particularly in patients with TNBC and patients not previously exposed to BB.

Measurement errors in the exposure and the outcome are said to be independent of each other if the measured exposure and the measured outcome are statistically independent conditional on the true exposure and true outcome (and dependent otherwise). Measurement error is said to be nondifferential if measurement of the exposure does not depend on the true outcome conditional on the true exposure and vice versa; otherwise it is said to be differential. Few results on differential and dependent measurement error are available in the literature. Here the authors use formal rules governing associations on signed directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to draw conclusions about the presence and sign of causal effects under differential and dependent measurement error. The authors apply these rules to 4 forms of measurement error: independent nondifferential, dependent nondifferential, independent differential, and dependent differential. For a binary exposure and outcome, the authors generalize Weinberg et al.'s (Am J Epidemiol. 1994;140(6):565-571) result for nondifferential measurement error on preserving the direction of a trend to settings which also allow measurement error in the outcome and to cases involving dependent and/or differential error.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ajog.2017.09.002},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a well-documented decline in fertility treatment success with increasing female age; however, there are few preconception cohort studies that have examined female age and natural fertility. In addition, data on male age and fertility are inconsistent. Given the increasing number of couples who are attempting conception at older ages, a more detailed characterization of age-related fecundability in the general population is of great clinical utility. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between female and male age with fecundability. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a web-based preconception cohort study of pregnancy planners from the United States and Canada. Participants were enrolled between June 2013 and July 2017. Eligible participants were 21-45 years old (female) or {\textgreater}/=21 years old (male) and had not been using fertility treatments. Couples were followed until pregnancy or for up to 12 menstrual cycles. We analyzed data from 2962 couples who had been trying to conceive for {\textless}/=3 cycles at study entry and reported no history of infertility. We used life-table methods to estimate the unadjusted cumulative pregnancy proportion at 6 and 12 cycles by female and male age. We used proportional probabilities regression models to estimate fecundability ratios, the per-cycle probability of conception for each age category relative to the referent (21-24 years old), and 95\% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Among female patients, the unadjusted cumulative pregnancy proportion at 6 cycles of attempt time ranged from 62.0\% (age 28-30 years) to 27.6\% (age 40-45 years); the cumulative pregnancy proportion at 12 cycles of attempt time ranged from 79.3\% (age 25-27 years old) to 55.5\% (age 40-45 years old). Similar patterns were observed among male patients, although differences between age groups were smaller. After adjusting for potential confounders, we observed a nearly monotonic decline in fecundability with increasing female age, with the exception of 28-33 years, at which point fecundability was relatively stable. Fecundability ratios were 0.91 (95\% confidence interval, 0.74-1.11) for ages 25-27, 0.88 (95\% confidence interval, 0.72-1.08) for ages 28-30, 0.87 (95\% confidence interval, 0.70-1.08) for ages 31-33, 0.82 (95\% confidence interval, 0.64-1.05) for ages 34-36, 0.60 (95\% confidence interval, 0.44-0.81) for ages 37-39, and 0.40 (95\% confidence interval, 0.22-0.73) for ages 40-45, compared with the reference group (age, 21-24 years). The association was stronger among nulligravid women. Male age was not associated appreciably with fecundability after adjustment for female age, although the number of men {\textgreater}45 years old was small (n=37). CONCLUSION: In this preconception cohort study of North American pregnancy planners, increasing female age was associated with an approximately linear decline in fecundability. Although we found little association between male age and fecundability, the small number of men in our study {\textgreater}45 years old limited our ability to draw conclusions on fecundability in older men.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: The 2011 American Heart Association guidelines identified pregnancy complications as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in women. However, miscarriage was not mentioned within the guidelines, and there is no consensus on the association between miscarriage and future risk of cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVE: To confirm or refute the association, a meta-analysis of published papers was conducted. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Knowledge and Scopus were systematically searched to identify appropriate articles. Reference lists were then hand searched for additional relevant titles. STUDY SELECTION: To be included, articles had to assess the association between miscarriage and subsequent cardiovascular disease in otherwise healthy women. Only women who had miscarriages were considered exposed. Pooled association measures, using random effects meta-analysis, were calculated for coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. Publication bias and between-study heterogeneity were evaluated. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors individually reviewed all studies and extracted data on patient and study characteristics along with cardiovascular outcomes. RESULTS: 10 studies were identified, with 517 504 individuals included in the coronary heart disease meta-analysis and 134 461 individuals in the cerebrovascular disease analysis. A history of miscarriage was associated with a greater odds of developing coronary heart disease, OR (95\% CI) =1.45 (1.18 to 1.78), but not with cerebrovascular disease, OR=1.11 (0.72 to 1.69). There was a strong association between recurrent miscarriage and coronary heart disease OR=1.99 (1.13 to 3.50). Evidence was found for moderate between-study heterogeneity and publication bias in the coronary heart disease analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis indicates that a history of miscarriage or recurrent miscarriage is associated with a greater risk of subsequent coronary heart disease.},

RA patients with VTE and comparison cohorts from population-based registries were compared. Increased risk of cancer in RA patients with VTE during the first year of VTE was observed. Risk of cancer in RA patients was increased also during the longer period following VTE. SUMMARY: Background It is unknown whether venous thromboembolism (VTE) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients can be a marker of occult cancer. Objectives To examine risk of cancer subsequent to VTE among RA patients compared with risk of cancer in an RA cohort without VTE and in a general population without RA and without VTE. Patients/Methods All RA patients with a first-time diagnosis of VTE (index date) during 1978-2013 and comparison cohorts were identified from population-based registries in Denmark. Results We identified three cohorts: 2497 RA patients with VTE, 11 672 RA patients without VTE and 12 730 persons from the general population. The cumulative incidence of cancer within the first year of the index date was 3.2\% among RA with VTE, 2.2\% among RA without VTE, and 2.0\% in the general population cohort. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were 1.79 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.37-2.33) for RA patients with VTE vs. RA patients without VTE and 2.12 (95\% CI, 1.63-2.76) for RA patients with VTE vs. the general population. The IRR of cancer at {\textgreater} 1 to 36 years from the index date among RA patients with VTE was 1.16 (95\% CI, 1.00-1.34) compared with the RA patients without VTE and 1.33 (95\% CI, 1.15-1.53) compared with the general population. Conclusions We found an increased risk of cancer in RA patients with VTE during the first year following VTE and also during the longer follow-up period. Thus, VTE may not only be a result of inflammation and immunological dysfunctions associated with RA, but may also be a marker for occult cancer.},

METHODS: We compared risks associated with first-trimester metformin use by diabetic women to nondiabetic women on no diabetes medication; we calculated crude odds ratios by exact logistic regression and adjusted by inverse probability weighting. Confounding by diabetes was assessed by comparing risks for metformin-exposed diabetic women to those for insulin-exposed diabetics and nondiabetics treated with metformin for subfertililty. RESULTS: Among 9,279 nonmalformed controls and 24,375 malformed cases, diabetics who used metformin (with or without insulin) had increased adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for several birth defects associated with diabetes. However, women treated with metformin for subfertility had aORs similar to or lower than those for diabetic metformin users, and many approximated the null. For atrial septal defect secundum, anorectal defects, and limb reduction defects, the estimates for metformin when used for subfertility were 2-3-fold. CONCLUSION: While metformin use for diabetes was associated with an increased risk of many birth defects, when metformin was used for subfertility most defects had aORs that approximated the null, while only three defects had modestly increased aORs, two of which had lower confidence bounds that included the null. Our study does not suggest that metformin poses an appreciable risk for major birth defects, but further studies are necessary.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy is common. Antihypertensive drugs are often used in the belief that lowering blood pressure will prevent progression to more severe disease, and thereby improve the outcome. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatments for women with mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2013) and reference lists of retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised trials evaluating any antihypertensive drug treatment for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy defined, whenever possible, as systolic blood pressure 140 to 169 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 90 to 109 mmHg. Comparisons were of one or more antihypertensive drug(s) with placebo, with no antihypertensive drug, or with another antihypertensive drug, and where treatment was planned to continue for at least seven days. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-nine trials (4723 women) were included. Twenty-nine trials compared an antihypertensive drug with placebo/no antihypertensive drug (3350 women). There is a halving in the risk of developing severe hypertension associated with the use of antihypertensive drug(s) (20 trials, 2558 women; risk ratio (RR) 0.49; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.60; risk difference (RD) -0.10 (-0.13 to -0.07); number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 10 (8 to 13)) but little evidence of a difference in the risk of pre-eclampsia (23 trials, 2851 women; RR 0.93; 95\% CI 0.80 to 1.08). Similarly, there is no clear effect on the risk of the baby dying (27 trials, 3230 women; RR 0.71; 95\% CI 0.49 to 1.02), preterm birth (15 trials, 2141 women; RR 0.96; 95\% CI 0.85 to 1.10), or small-for-gestational-age babies (20 trials, 2586 women; RR 0.97; 95\% CI 0.80 to 1.17). There were no clear differences in any other outcomes.Twenty-two trials (1723 women) compared one antihypertensive drug with another. Alternative drugs seem better than methyldopa for reducing the risk of severe hypertension (11 trials, 638 women; RR (random-effects) 0.54; 95\% CI 0.30 to 0.95; RD -0.11 (-0.20 to -0.02); NNTH 7 (5 to 69)). There is also a reduction in the overall risk of developing proteinuria/pre-eclampsia when beta blockers and calcium channel blockers considered together are compared with methyldopa (11 trials, 997 women; RR 0.73; 95\% CI 0.54 to 0.99). However, the effect on both severe hypertension and proteinuria is not seen in the individual drugs. Other outcomes were only reported by a small proportion of studies, and there were no clear differences. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: It remains unclear whether antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy is worthwhile.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies are inconclusive on the relationship between parity and cardiovascular disease (CVD), with few evaluating multiple cardiovascular outcomes. It is also unclear if any relationship between parity and CVD is independent of breastfeeding. We examined the associations between parity and cardiovascular outcomes, including breastfeeding adjustment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were from 8,583 White and African American women, 45-64 years of age, in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. Coronary heart disease (CHD), myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure, and strokes were ascertained from 1987 to 2016 by annual interviews and hospital surveillance. Parity and breastfeeding were self-reported. Cox proportional hazards regression estimated hazard ratios (HR) for the association between parity and cardiovascular outcomes, adjusting for baseline sociodemographic, clinical and lifestyle factors, and breastfeeding. RESULTS: Women reported no pregnancies (6.0\%), or having 0 (1.6\%), 1-2 (36.2\%), 3-4 (36.4\%), or 5+ (19.7\%) live births. During 30 years follow-up, there were 1,352 CHDs, 843 MIs, 750 strokes, and 1,618 heart failure events. Compared with women with 1-2 prior births, those with prior pregnancies and no live births had greater incident CHD (HR = 1.64, 95\% confidence interval 1.14-2.42) and heart failure risk (1.46, 1.04-2.05), after adjustment for baseline characteristics. Women with 5+ births had greater risk of CHD (1.29, 1.10-1.52) and hospitalized MI (1.38, 1.13-1.69), after adjustment for baseline characteristics and breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS: In a diverse U.S. cohort, a history of 5+ live births is associated with CHD risk, specifically, MI, independent of breastfeeding. Having a prior pregnancy and no live birth is associated with greater CHD and heart failure risk.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Maternal cancer may be associated with offspring mental and behavioural disorders through various biological pathways. When postnatally diagnosed, it may cause stress and changes in care, potentially influencing mental health. Prenatally diagnosed cancer could lead to maternal stress and treatment, or influence fetal neural development. This study investigates associations between prenatally or postnatally diagnosed maternal cancers, and mental and behavioural disorders in children. METHODS: The study comprised of 2,158,430 children born in Denmark (1978-2012). Children were exposed if their mother received a cancer diagnosis prenatally (two years prepartum, until birth) or postnatally (birth, until 18 years postpartum). Further analyses considered cancer types and diagnostic delays. Children were followed until 18 years of age or the first of the following: diagnosis of a mental or behavioural disorder, emigration, death, end of follow-up RESULTS: During follow-up 79,682 (3.7\%) children were diagnosed with mental or behavioural disorders. There was an increased risk among offspring exposed to postnatally diagnosed cancers (HR 1.05, 95\% CI: 1.00-1.11); for prenatally diagnosed cancers HR was 1.07 (0.87-1.31). The strongest associations for disorder types were for prenatal diagnoses with mood/affective disorders (HR: 2.45; 1.02-5.89) and postnatal diagnoses with mood/affective disorders (HR: 1.43; 1.14-1.79). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate a link between maternal cancer occurrence during pregnancy or early postnatal life, and mental and behavioural disorders in offspring. This association could be driven by common factors in the two periods, such as psychological stress or genetic factors. No specific fetal programming was identified.},

DESIGN AND SETTING: Post hoc analysis of the Hokusai-VTE study, a multicentre, randomised, double-blind trial comparing edoxaban with warfarin for acute symptomatic VTE. POPULATION: Women below 50 years receiving edoxaban or warfarin for treatment of VTE. METHODS: We collected data on diagnostic measures, treatment, and clinical outcome of abnormal vaginal bleeding events. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Occurrence of major and clinically relevant nonmajor (CRNM) abnormal vaginal bleeding events. RESULTS: In all, 628 women aged under 50 years were treated with edoxaban and 665 with warfarin. The rate of abnormal vaginal bleeding was 15/100 person-years (py) (95\% CI 11-19) in women receiving edoxaban and 9/100 py (95\% CI 6-12) in the warfarin group (hazard ratio: 1.7, 95\% CI 1.1-2.5). Major abnormal vaginal bleeding occurred in eight (1.3\%) women on edoxaban and in three (0.9\%) women receiving warfarin [odds ratio (OR) 2.8; 95\% CI 0.8-10.8], and CRNM abnormal vaginal bleeding occurred in 53 (8.4\%) women treated with edoxaban and in 37 (5.6\%) on warfarin therapy (OR 1.6, 95\% CI 1.0-2.4). Over 85\% of all vaginal bleeds were characterised by heavy menstrual bleeding. Major bleeds frequently required treatment, and in more than 75\% of patients anticoagulant therapy was adjusted. The severity of clinical presentation and course of major and CRNM bleeds was mild in most patients. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal vaginal bleeding occurred more frequently in women treated with edoxaban than with warfarin. Reassuringly, most events could be managed conservatively and had a mild outcome.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Uncontrolled confounders are an important source of bias in epidemiologic studies. The authors review and derive a set of parallel simple formulas for bias factors in the risk difference, risk ratio, and odds ratio from studies with an unmeasured polytomous confounder and a dichotomous exposure and outcome. METHODS: The authors show how the bias formulas are related to and are sometimes simpler than earlier formulas. The article contains three examples, including a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis of a preadjusted or conditional estimate. RESULTS: All the bias expressions can be given parallel formulations as the difference or ratio of (i) the sum across confounder strata of each exposure-stratified confounder-outcome effect measure multiplied by the confounder prevalences among the exposed and (ii) the sum across confounder strata of the same effect measure multiplied by the confounder prevalences among the unexposed. The basic formulas can be applied to scenarios with a polytomous confounder, exposure, or outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to aiding design and analysis strategies for confounder control, the bias formulas provide a link between classical standardization decompositions of demography and classical bias formulas of epidemiology. They are also useful in constructing general programs for sensitivity analysis and more elaborate probabilistic risk analyses.},

Bias analysis for such uncontrolled confounding is most useful in big data studies and systematic reviews to gauge the extent to which extraneous preexposure variables that affect the exposure and the outcome can explain some or all of the reported exposure-outcome associations. We review methods that can be applied during or after data analysis to adjust for uncontrolled confounding for different outcomes, confounders, and study settings. We discuss relevant bias formulas and how to obtain the required information for applying them. Finally, we develop a new intuitive generalized bias analysis framework for simulating and adjusting for the amount of uncontrolled confounding due to not measuring and adjusting for one or more confounders.},

Despite the various estimation methods and statistical routines being developed, a unified approach for effect estimation under different effect decomposition scenarios is still needed for epidemiologic research. G-computation offers such unification and has been used for total effect and joint controlled direct effect estimation settings, involving different types of exposure and outcome variables. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of parametric g-computation in estimating various components of the total effect, including (1) natural direct and indirect effects, (2) standard and stochastic controlled direct effects, and (3) reference and mediated interaction effects, using Monte Carlo simulations in standard statistical software. For each study subject, we estimated their nested potential outcomes corresponding to the (mediated) effects of an intervention on the exposure wherein the mediator was allowed to attain the value it would have under a possible counterfactual exposure intervention, under a pre-specified distribution of the mediator independent of any causes, or under a fixed controlled value. A final regression of the potential outcome on the exposure intervention variable was used to compute point estimates and bootstrap was used to obtain confidence intervals. Through contrasting different potential outcomes, this analytical framework provides an intuitive way of estimating effects under the recently introduced 3- and 4-way effect decomposition. This framework can be extended to complex multivariable and longitudinal mediation settings.},

AIM: We aimed to explore the risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among children in relation to pre- and postnatal exposure to air pollution from road traffic. METHODS: Parents of 3,426 twins born in Stockholm during 1992-2000 were interviewed, when their children were 9 or 12 years old, for symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders. Residence time-weighted concentrations of particulate matter with a diameter {\textless}10 mum (PM10) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from road traffic were estimated at participants' addresses during pregnancy, the first year, and the ninth year of life using dispersion modeling, controlling for seasonal variation. Multivariate regression models were used to examine the association between air pollution exposure and neurodevelopmental outcomes, adjusting for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: No clear or consistent associations were found between air pollution exposure during any of the three time windows and any of the neurodevelopmental outcomes. For example, a 5-95\% difference in exposure to NOx during pregnancy was associated with odds ratios (ORs) of 0.92 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.44-1.96) and 0.90 (95\% CI: 0.58-1.40) for ASD and ADHD respectively. A corresponding range in exposure to PM10 during pregnancy was related to ORs of 1.01 (95\% CI: 0.52-1.96) and 1.00 (95\% CI: 0.68-1.47) for ASD and ADHD.

PARTICIPANTS: MOBAND-CP is a cohort of more than 210 000 children, created as a collaboration between the world's two largest pregnancy cohorts-the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort study (MoBa) and the Danish National Birth Cohort. MOBAND-CP includes maternal interview/questionnaire data collected during pregnancy and follow-up, plus linked information from national health registries. FINDINGS TO DATE: Initial harmonisation of data from the 2 cohorts has created 140 variables for children and their mothers. In the MOBAND-CP cohort, 438 children with CP have been identified through record linkage with validated national registries, providing by far the largest such sample with prospectively collected detailed pregnancy data. Several studies investigating various hypotheses regarding CP aetiology are currently on-going. FUTURE PLANS: Additional data can be harmonised as necessary to meet requirements of new projects. Biological specimens collected during pregnancy and at delivery are potentially available for assay, as are results from assays conducted on these specimens for other projects. The study size allows consideration of CP subtypes, which is rare in aetiological studies of CP. In addition, MOBAND-CP provides a platform within the context of a merged birth cohort of exceptional size that could, after appropriate permissions have been sought, be used for cohort and case-cohort studies of other relatively rare health conditions of infants and children.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Cancer and birth defects cluster in families more often than expected by chance, but the reasons are neither well known nor well studied. METHODS: From singletons born alive in Denmark between 1 January 1977 and 31 December 2007, we identified children who had no congenital malformations but had a full or half sibling with a congenital malformation (CM) diagnosed in the first year of life; this constituted the exposed group, while children whose siblings had no such condition constituted a reference group. We estimated cancer risks for children who had a full sibling or a half sibling with a CM using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. To control for confounding related to change of family structure, we estimated cancer risks for children from core families and children from broken families separately. Children were followed from birth up to 30 years of age (median follow-up 13.6 years). We obtained information on CMs and cancer from the Danish National Hospital Register and the Danish Cancer Registry. RESULTS: We identified 991,454 (78\%) children from core families with 53,995 children who had a full sibling with a CM and 277,773 (22\%) children from broken families with 7200 children who had a full sibling with a CM and 6194 children who had a half sibling with a CM. Children who had a full sibling with a CM from both core and broken families showed, in general, no increased cancer risk compared with children whose siblings had no CM, except in the case of children who had a full sibling with a CM in the nervous system (HR=2.61, 95\%CI:1.60-4.27) or in the eye, ear, face, or neck (HR=2.47, 95\%CI: 1.46-4.18). Children who had a half sibling with a CM seemed to have a higher cancer risk in early adulthood (HR=1.87, 95\%CI: 0.98-3.56). CONCLUSIONS: Children who had a full sibling with a CM had no increased risk of cancer except for those who had a full sibling with a CM in the nervous system or in the eye, ear, face or neck. Children with a half-sibling with a CM tended to have an increased cancer risk in early adulthood, perhaps a result of chance. This study should be replicated using other data sources.},

Areas covered: We argue for action inspired by these well analyzed studies that are based on five prospective cohorts data collected from different countries. Several analytical options have been employed especially to address confounding, and all analyses have consistently suggested that confounding alone is an unlikely explanation for this disturbing observation. Expert opinion: Acetaminophen is often used for minor symptom or discomfort where the treatment has no strong indication and carries little, if any risk for the pregnant women.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paracetamol is used extensively during pregnancy, but studies regarding the potential neurodevelopmental sequelae of foetal paracetamol exposure are lacking. Method Between 1999 and 2008 all pregnant Norwegian women were eligible for recruitment into the prospective Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. The mothers were asked to report on their use of paracetamol at gestational weeks 17 and 30 and at 6 months postpartum. We used data on 48 631 children whose mothers returned the 3-year follow-up questionnaire by May 2011. Within this sample were 2919 same-sex sibling pairs who were used to adjust for familial and genetic factors. We modelled psychomotor development (communication, fine and gross motor development), externalizing and internalizing behaviour problems, and temperament (emotionality, activity, sociability and shyness) based on prenatal paracetamol exposure using generalized linear regression, adjusting for a number of factors, including febrile illness, infections and co-medication use during pregnancy. RESULTS: The sibling-control analysis revealed that children exposed to prenatal paracetamol for more than 28 days had poorer gross motor development [beta 0.24, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.12-0.51], communication (beta 0.20, 95\% CI 0.01-0.39), externalizing behaviour (beta 0.28, 95\% CI 0.15-0.42), internalizing behaviour (beta 0.14, 95\% CI 0.01-0.28), and higher activity levels (beta 0.24, 95\% CI 0.11-0.38). Children exposed prenatally to short-term use of paracetamol (1-27 days) also had poorer gross motor outcomes (beta 0.10, 95\% CI 0.02-0.19), but the effects were smaller than with long-term use. Ibuprofen exposure was not associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes. CONCLUSION: Children exposed to long-term use of paracetamol during pregnancy had substantially adverse developmental outcomes at 3 years of age.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To explore the presence of shared underlying causes of cerebral palsy (CP) and other neurodevelopmental disorders, by examining risks of other disorders in siblings of children with CP. METHODS: We used Norwegian national registries to identify 1.4 million pairs of full siblings (singletons) and 28 000 sets of twins born from 1967 to 2006, identify stillbirths and neonatal deaths, and find individuals with CP, epilepsy, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, blindness, deafness, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Associations between CP in 1 sibling and neurodevelopmental disorders or early death in other siblings were estimated using logistic regression models. RESULTS: There were 5707 neonatal survivors (beyond 28 days) with CP (2.5/1000). These children had substantial comorbidity (eg, 29\% had epilepsy). Singleton siblings of (singleton) children with CP had increased risks of neurodevelopmental problems, including epilepsy (odds ratio [OR], 1.8 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.5-2.5]), intellectual disability (OR, 2.3 [95\% CI, 1.8-2.9]), autism spectrum disorders (OR, 1.6 [95\% CI, 1.1-2.2]), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (OR 1.3 [95\% CI, 1.1-1.6]), blindness (OR 2.4 [95\% CI, 1.1-5.4]), and schizophrenia (OR 2.0 [95\% CI, 1.2-3.2]). There was no increase in risk of bipolar disorder (OR 1.0 [95\% CI, 0.6-1.6]). Families with children with CP also had increased risk of losing another child in the perinatal period (stillbirth OR, 1.8 [95\% CI, 1.5- 2.3]; neonatal death OR, 1.7 [95\% CI, 1.3-2.2]). Associations were stronger within sets of twins. CONCLUSIONS: Siblings of a child with CP were at increased risk for a variety of other neurodevelopmental morbidities, as well as early death, indicating the presence of shared underlying causes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review was to examine the incidence and prevalence of comorbidity between Cerebral Palsy (CP), Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). METHODS: We searched for articles indexed in PubMed, EBSCOhost, Scopus, Web of Science and other potentially relevant internet sources using a combination of expressions including "cerebral palsy" AND "autism" OR "ASD" OR "pervasive development disorder" AND "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder" OR "ADHD". RESULTS: We identified 2542 studies on CP and ASD and 998 studies on CP and ADHD. After screening titles and abstracts and removing duplicated studies, 47 full papers (CP and ASD n = 28; CP and ADHD n = 19) were downloaded and screened for eligibility. Twenty-eight (CP and ASD n = 16; CP and ADHD n = 12) studies were identified in the peer-review literature. Based on this systematic review, ASD and ADHD seem to be more common in people with CP than in the general population, yet the gold standard methods for diagnosing ASD or ADHD are not suitable for children with motor problems. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing the occurrence of ASD and ADHD would improve the significant cost of healthcare, therapies, and overall daily living for families with children affected by CP. However, psychometric studies are needed in the future to promote development of measures suitable for individuals with CP. In addition, this review highlights the paucity of peer-reviewed studies investigating the occurrence of ASD and ADHD in children with different CP subtypes or functional abilities, and there are still some open questions about pathogenic mechanisms common to CP, ASD and ADHD.},

No study had been conducted to explore the relationship between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and diabetes.

METHODS: A total of 4,302 patients with ADHD were selected as cases and 21,510 randomly selected subjects as controls. We used conditional logistic regression to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for having previously received a diagnosis of DM between subjects with and without ADHD. RESULTS: In this study, 116 of the 25,812 sampled subjects (0.5\%) had received a diagnosis of DM prior to their index date. Subjects with ADHD had a higher proportion of prior DM diagnoses than controls (0.9\% vs. 0.4\%, P {\textless} 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, index year, geographic location, and obesity, ADHD was significantly associated with a prior diagnosis of type 2 DM (OR = 2.75, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.82-4.16). However, no significant association was observed between ADHD and type 1 DM. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that ADHD was associated with a previous diagnosis of type 2 DM.},

Any alteration in this chemical dialogue has the potential to result in adverse pregnancy outcomes including miscarriage. Sporadic miscarriage is the most common complication of pregnancy and can be caused by multiple factors. While the most common cause of miscarriage is genetic abnormalities in the fetus, other contributing factors certainly can play a role in early loss. One such factor is environmental exposure, in particular to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which has the potential to interfere with endogenous hormone action. These effects can be deleterious, especially in early pregnancy when the hormonal milieu surrounding implantation is in delicate balance.

	abstract = {Accidental contamination of livestock in Michigan in 1973 with polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) led to the establishment of a registry of exposed individuals in 1976. At the time of enrollment, serum was collected and analyzed for PBBs and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In 1997, women aged 18 years or older and active in the registry were invited to participate in a telephone interview about their health. Using generalized estimating equations to account for correlated outcomes within the same woman, we assessed the risk of spontaneous abortion among 529 women with 1344 potentially exposed pregnancies. PBB and PCB exposure were not associated with risk of spontaneous abortion after adjusting for maternal age at conception, age at menarche, and prior infertility. Compared to pregnancies with PBB exposure below the limit of detection, those with levels above 2.9 ppb had a non-significant reduced odds of spontaneous abortion (adjusted OR=0.73; 95\% CI=0.47-1.13). Compared to pregnancies with PCB exposure below the limit of detection, those with levels above 6.5 ppb had little difference in risk (adjusted OR=0.91; 95\% CI=0.59-1.41). Maternal age at conception above 34 years was significantly associated with elevated risk of spontaneous abortion (OR=2.46; 95\% CI=1.10-5.49). The effect of prior infertility was of borderline significance (OR=1.52; 95\% CI=0.98-2.38).

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have indicated that shift work, long working hours, and prevalent workplace exposures such as lifting, standing, and physical workload increase the risk of miscarriage, but the evidence is conflicting. We conducted a systematic review of original research reports. METHODS: A search in Medline and EMBASE 1966-2012 identified 30 primary papers reporting the relative risk (RR) of miscarriage according to {\textgreater}/=1 of 5 occupational activities of interest. Following an assessment of completeness of reporting, confounding, and bias, each risk estimate was characterized as more or less likely to be biased. Studies with equivalent measures of exposure were pooled to obtain a weighted common risk estimate. Sensitivity analyses excluded studies most likely to be biased. RESULTS: Working fixed nights was associated with a moderately increased risk of miscarriage (pooled RR 1.51 [95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 1.27-1.78, N=5), while working in 3-shift schedules, working for 40-52 hours weekly, lifting {\textgreater}100 kg/day, standing {\textgreater}6-8 hours/day and physical workload were associated with small risk increments, with the pooled RR ranging from 1.12 (3-shift schedule, N=7) to 1.36 (working hours, N=10). RR for working hours and standing became smaller when analyses were restricted to higher quality studies. CONCLUSIONS: These largely reassuring findings do not provide a strong case for mandatory restrictions in relation to shift work, long working hours, occupational lifting, standing, and physical workload. Considering the limited evidence base, however, it may be prudent to advise women against work entailing high levels of these exposures and women with at-risk pregnancies should receive tailored individual counseling.},

Recent studies have also indicated that PM may be a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). A pattern of increasing prevalence of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been suggested to partly be linked to environmental pollutants exposure, including PM. Epidemiological studies suggest associations between pre- or postnatal exposure to air pollution components and ADHD symptoms. However, many studies are cross-sectional without possibility to reveal causality. Cohort studies are often small with poor exposure characterization, and confounded by traffic noise and socioeconomic factors, possibly overestimating the study associations. Furthermore, the mechanistic knowledge how exposure to PM during early brain development may contribute to increased risk of ADHD symptoms or cognitive deficits is limited. The closure of this knowledge gap requires the combined use of well-designed longitudinal cohort studies, supported by mechanistic in vitro studies. As ADHD has profound consequences for the children affected and their families, the identification of preventable risk factors such as air pollution exposure should be of high priority.},

Etiology of ADHD is not well understood. We investigated whether outdoor air pollution and greenspace affect ADHD incidence in children residing in Saxony. METHODS: 66,823 children, all beneficiaries of the statutory health insurance company AOK PLUS and born between 2000 and 2004, were followed until 2014. We considered any child with at least one ICD-10-GM F90 diagnosis by a child/adolescent psychiatrist, neuropaediatrician, or psychotherapist an ADHD case. Children's home addresses were known up to their four-digit postal code area. Population-weighted mean values of particulate matter with diameter of {\textless}10mum (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated for 186 postal code areas. Associations with each exposure were assessed by two-level adjusted Poisson regression models. RESULTS: 2044 children (3.06\%) were diagnosed with ADHD within the observation period. An increase of PM10 and NO2 by 10mug/m(3) raised the relative risk of ADHD by a factor of 1.97 [95\% CI: 1.35-2.86] and 1.32 [1.10-1.58], respectively. A 0.1-unit increase in NDVI decreased the relative risk of ADHD by a factor of 0.82 [0.68-0.98]. Better access to child/adolescent psychiatrists was the most important confounder that increased ADHD risk across all models. CONCLUSION: Our results provide some evidence that air pollution might affect ADHD. Future studies with more detailed address information and better control for confounders, in particular socioeconomic status and parental psychopathology, should replicate the observed associations.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common cognitive and behavioural disorder diagnosed among school children. It is characterized by deficient attention and problem solving, along with hyperactivity and difficulty withholding incorrect responses. This highly prevalent disorder is estimated to affect 5-10\% of children and in many cases, persists into adulthood, leading to 4\% prevalence among adults. Converging evidence from epidemiologic, neuropsychology, neuroimaging, genetic and treatment studies shows that ADHD is a valid medical disorder. The majority of studies performed to assess genetic risk factors in ADHD have supported a strong familial nature of this disorder. Family studies have identified a 2- to 8-fold increase in the risk for ADHD in parents and siblings of children with ADHD. Various twin and adoption studies have also highlighted the highly genetic nature of ADHD. In fact the mean heritability of ADHD was shown to be 0.77, which is comparable to other neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. However, several biological and environmental factors have also been proposed as risk factors for ADHD, including food additives/diet, lead contamination, cigarette and alcohol exposure, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and low birth weight. Many recent studies have specifically examined the relationships between ADHD and these extraneous factors. This review describes some of these possible risk factors. CONCLUSION: Although a substantial fraction of the aetiology of ADHD is due to genes, the studies reviewed in this article show that many environmental risk factors and potential gene-environment interactions also increase the risk for the disorder.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We examine whether pregnancy weight (pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and/or weight gain) is related to core symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in school-age offspring. DESIGN: Follow-up of prospective pregnancy cohorts from Sweden, Denmark and Finland within the Nordic Network on ADHD. METHODS: Maternal pregnancy and delivery data were collected prospectively. Teachers rated inattention and hyperactivity symptoms in offspring. High scores were defined as at least one core symptom rated as 'severe' and two as 'present' (approximately 10\% of children scored in this range). Logistic regression and latent class analyses were used to examine maternal pregnancy weight in relation to children's ADHD core symptoms. RESULTS: Teacher rated 12 556 school-aged children. Gestational weight gain outside of the Institute of Medicine guidelines was not related to ADHD symptoms (below recommendations: odds ratio (OR): 0.96; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.81, 1.14; above recommendations: OR: 0.98; 95\% CI: 0.82, 1.16). To examine various patterns of pre-pregnancy BMI and weight gain, we used latent class analysis and found significant associations between classes that included pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity and a high ADHD symptom score in offspring, ORs ranged between 1.37 (95\% CI: 1.07, 1.75) and 1.89 (95\% CI: 1.13, 3.15) adjusted for gestational age, birth weight, weight gain, pregnancy smoking, maternal age, maternal education, child gender, family structure and cohort country of origin. Children of women who were both overweight and gained a large amount of weight during gestation had a 2-fold risk of ADHD symptoms (OR: 2.10, 95\% CI: 1.19, 3.72) compared to normal-weight women. CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time that pre-pregnancy BMI is associated with ADHD symptoms in children. Our results are of public health significance if the associations are causal and will then add ADHD symptoms in offspring to the list of deleterious outcomes related to overweight and obesity in the prenatal period.},

	abstract = {Pre-pregnancy maternal obesity is associated with adverse offspring outcomes at birth and later in life. Individual studies have shown that epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation could contribute. Within the Pregnancy and Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) Consortium, we meta-analysed the association between pre-pregnancy maternal BMI and methylation at over 450,000 sites in newborn blood DNA, across 19 cohorts (9,340 mother-newborn pairs). We attempted to infer causality by comparing the effects of maternal versus paternal BMI and incorporating genetic variation. In four additional cohorts (1,817 mother-child pairs), we meta-analysed the association between maternal BMI at the start of pregnancy and blood methylation in adolescents. In newborns, maternal BMI was associated with small ({\textless}0.2\% per BMI unit (1 kg/m2), P {\textless} 1.06 x 10-7) methylation variation at 9,044 sites throughout the genome. Adjustment for estimated cell proportions greatly attenuated the number of significant CpGs to 104, including 86 sites common to the unadjusted model. At 72/86 sites, the direction of the association was the same in newborns and adolescents, suggesting persistence of signals. However, we found evidence for acausal intrauterine effect of maternal BMI on newborn methylation at just 8/86 sites. In conclusion, this well-powered analysis identified robust associations between maternal adiposity and variations in newborn blood DNA methylation, but these small effects may be better explained by genetic or lifestyle factors than a causal intrauterine mechanism. This highlights the need for large-scale collaborative approaches and the application of causal inference techniques in epigenetic epidemiology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased risk of offspring attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the role of unmeasured familial confounding for this association remains unclear. METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study via linkage of Swedish national and regional registers to investigate maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (underweight: BMI {\textless}18.5; overweight: 25{\textless}/= BMI {\textless}30; obesity: BMI {\textgreater}/=30) in relation to offspring ADHD. We followed 673 632 individuals born in Sweden between 1992 and 2000, with prospectively collected information on maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, until they received an ADHD diagnosis or ADHD medication, death, emigration or 31 December 2009. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models. Stratified Cox proportional hazards models were applied to data on full siblings to control for unmeasured familial confounding. RESULTS: At the population level, pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity was associated with increased risk of offspring ADHD (HR(overweight) = 1.23, 95\% CI = 1.18-1.27, P = 0.01; HR(obesity) = 1.64, 95\% CI = 1.57-1.73, P = 0.01), after adjustment for measured covariates. In full sibling comparisons, however, previously observed associations no longer remained (HR(overweight) = 0.98, 95\% CI = 0.83-1.16, P = 0.82; HR(obesity) = 1.15, 95\% CI = 0.85-1.56, P = 0.38). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that the association between maternal pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity and offspring ADHD could be ascribed to unmeasured familial confounding.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate risks of recurrence of cerebral palsy in family members with various degrees of relatedness to elucidate patterns of hereditability. DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: Data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, linked to the Norwegian social insurance scheme to identify cases of cerebral palsy and to databases of Statistics Norway to identify relatives. PARTICIPANTS: 2,036,741 Norwegians born during 1967-2002, 3649 of whom had a diagnosis of cerebral palsy; 22,558 pairs of twins, 1,851,144 pairs of first degree relatives, 1,699,856 pairs of second degree relatives, and 5,165,968 pairs of third degree relatives were identified. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cerebral palsy. RESULTS: If one twin had cerebral palsy, the relative risk of recurrence of cerebral palsy was 15.6 (95\% confidence interval 9.8 to 25) in the other twin. In families with an affected singleton child, risk was increased 9.2 (6.4 to 13)-fold in a subsequent full sibling and 3.0 (1.1 to 8.6)-fold in a half sibling. Affected parents were also at increased risk of having an affected child (6.5 (1.6 to 26)-fold). No evidence was found of differential transmission through mothers or fathers, although the study had limited power to detect such differences. For people with an affected first cousin, only weak evidence existed for an increased risk (1.5 (0.9 to 2.7)-fold). Risks in siblings or cousins were independent of sex of the index case. After exclusion of preterm births (an important risk factor for cerebral palsy), familial risks remained and were often stronger. CONCLUSIONS: People born into families in which someone already has cerebral palsy are themselves at elevated risk, depending on their degree of relatedness. Elevated risk may extend even to third degree relatives (first cousins). The patterns of risk suggest multifactorial inheritance, in which multiple genes interact with each other and with environmental factors. These data offer additional evidence that the underlying causes of cerebral palsy extend beyond the clinical management of delivery.},

DESIGN: Review of meta-analyses. STUDY SELECTION: Meta-analyses of emerging cardiovascular biomarkers (not part of the Framingham risk score) that included datasets from at least one observational study and at least one randomised controlled trial were identified through Medline (last update, January 2011). DATA EXTRACTION: Study-specific risk ratios were extracted from all identified meta-analyses and synthesised with random effects for (a) all studies, and (b) separately for observational and for randomised controlled trial populations for comparison. RESULTS: 31 eligible meta-analyses were identified. For seven major biomarkers (C reactive protein, non-HDL cholesterol, lipoprotein(a), post-load glucose, fibrinogen, B-type natriuretic peptide, and troponins), the prognostic effect was significantly stronger in datasets from observational studies than in datasets from randomised controlled trials. For five of the biomarkers the effect was less than half as strong in the randomised controlled trial datasets. Across all 31 meta-analyses, on average datasets from observational studies suggested larger prognostic effects than those from randomised controlled trials; from a random effects meta-analysis, the estimated average difference in the effect size was 24\% (95\% CI 7\% to 40\%) of the overall biomarker effect. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular biomarkers often have less promising results in the evidence derived from randomised controlled trials than from observational studies.},

	abstract = {Recent work demonstrated that propensity score matching may lead to increased covariate imbalance, even with the corresponding decrease in propensity score distance between matched units. The extent to which this paradoxical phenomenon might harm causal inference in real epidemiologic studies has not been explored. We evaluated the effect of this phenomenon using insurance claims data from the Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly (1999-2002) and Medicaid Analytic eXtract (2000-2007) databases. For each dataset, we created several 1:1 propensity score-matched datasets by manipulating the size of the covariate set used to generate propensity scores, the index exposure prevalence in the pre-matched dataset and the matching algorithm. We matched all index units, then progressively pruned matched sets in order of decreasing propensity score distance, calculating covariate imbalance after each pruning. Although covariate imbalance sometimes increased after progressive pruning of matched sets, the application of commonly-used propensity score calipers for defining an acceptable match stopped pruning near the lowest region of the imbalance trend and resulted in an improvement over the imbalance in the pre-matched dataset. Thus, propensity score matching does not appear to induce increased covariate imbalance when standard propensity score calipers are applied in these types of pharmacoepidemiologic studies.},

Methods and results: A nationwide population-based follow-up study based on the Danish Heart Failure Registry. All Danish hospital departments caring for patients with HF. We identified 24,308 in-and outpatients diagnosed with HF from 2003 to 2010. Quality of care was defined as receiving the guideline recommended processes of care: use of echocardiography, New-York-Heart-Association -classification, treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-II-receptor blocker, betablockers, physical training and patient education. Main outcome measure: 1-year mortality. We used multiple imputation and multivariable Cox Proportional Hazard Regression to compute Hazard Ratios (HRs) for 1-year mortality adjusted for potential confounding factors. Within 1 year, 17.1\% of the patients died and the adjusted HRs ranged from 0.61 (95\% Confidence Interval ((CI) 0.55-0.67)) for patient education to 0.99 (95\% CI 0.90-1.10) for betablocker therapy. The association between meeting more performance measures and 1-year mortality appeared to follow a dose-response pattern: Using 0-25\% of fulfilled measures as reference, patients who fulfilled 76- 100\% of the performance measures had an adjusted HR of 0.43 (95\% CI 0.38-0.48), while the adjusted HR was 0.96 (95\% CI 0.86-1.07) for patients who fulfilled between 26-50\% of the performance measures. Conclusion: Meeting process performance measures, which reflect care in concordance with clinical guideline recommendations, was associated with substantially lower 1-year mortality among patients with incident HF.},

In this paper we illustrate the steps for estimating ATT and ATU using g-computation implemented via Monte Carlo simulation. METHODS: To obtain marginal effect estimates for ATT and ATU we used a three-step approach: fitting a model for the outcome, generating potential outcome variables for ATT and ATU separately, and regressing each potential outcome variable on treatment intervention. RESULTS: The estimates for ATT, ATU and average treatment effect (ATE) were of similar magnitude, with ATE being in between ATT and ATU as expected. In our illustrative example, the effect (risk difference [RD]) of a higher education on angina among the participants who indeed have at least a high school education (ATT) was -0.019 (95\% CI: -0.040, -0.007) and that among those who have less than a high school education in India (ATU) was -0.012 (95\% CI: -0.036, 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: The g-computation algorithm is a powerful way of estimating standardized estimates like the ATT and ATU. Its use should be encouraged in modern epidemiologic teaching and practice.},

We employed quasi-experimental techniques to test the hypothesis that EITC refund receipt is associated with short-term improvements in child health. The data set included children surveyed in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N=7,444). We employed a difference-in-differences approach, exploiting the seasonal nature of EITC refund receipt. We compared children of EITC-eligible families interviewed immediately after refund receipt (February-April) with those interviewed during other months (May-January), differencing out seasonal variation among non-EITC-eligible families. We examined outcomes that were likely to be affected immediately after refund receipt, including general health, nutrition, metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers, and test scores. There were improvements in physician-reported overall health after refund receipt, but no changes in infection, serum metabolic or inflammatory markers, or test scores, and contradictory findings for food insufficiency. In summary, EITC refunds are not strongly associated with most short-term health outcomes among recipients' children, although numerous previous studies have demonstrated impacts on longer-term outcomes. This highlights the importance of examining the effects of public policies on beneficiaries and their children using varying study designs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy approximately halves the risk of recurrence in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer patients, but many women respond insufficiently to therapy. Expression of multi-drug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) in breast cancer may potentiate tamoxifen resistance. Thus, we investigated the expression of MRP2 in breast cancer as a predictor of tamoxifen therapy effectiveness. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study nested in the Danish Breast Cancer Group clinical database. The study included women aged 35-69 years diagnosed with stage l-lll breast cancer during 1985-2001, in Jutland, Denmark. We identified 541 recurrent breast cancers (cases) among women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) disease treated with tamoxifen for at least 1 year (ER+/TAM+) and 300 cases among women with estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) disease, never treated with tamoxifen (ER-/TAM-). We matched one recurrence-free control to each recurrent case. We retrieved paraffin-embedded primary tumor tissue for all patients, and all available recurrent tumor tissue from pathology archives. MRP2 expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. We computed odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs) associating MRP2 expression (positive vs. none) with breast cancer recurrence in conditional logistic regression models. We compared MRP2 expression in paired primary- and recurrent tumors. RESULTS: MRP2 expression was more prevalent in the ER+/TAM + group, than in the ER-/TAM - group. No predictive utility of MRP2 for breast cancer recurrence was found in the ER+/TAM + group (ORadj = 0.96, 95\% CI 0.70, 1.33). Further, no prognostic utility was found in the ER-/TAM - group (ORadj = 0.81, 95\% CI 0.53, 1.23). MRP2 expression was not increased in recurrent versus primary tumors. CONCLUSIONS: MRP2 expression is neither a predictive marker of tamoxifen effectiveness nor a prognostic marker in breast cancer.},

We conducted a case-control study in Denmark, using data linked from population-based health and administrative registries. We identified all cases of RCC from 1996 to 2013 and sampled population controls in a 10:1 ratio from the underlying population free of RCC, while matching on sex, birth year and calendar time. Bisphosphonate use before RCC diagnosis, excluding the year leading up to the diagnosis, was measured using outpatient prescription dispensations. We used conditional logistic regression to compute crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) comparing ever vs. never bisphosphonate use in doses indicated for treatment of osteoporosis, overall and stratified by sex, with the OR estimating the incidence rate ratio. We also examined the effects by cumulative dose and specific agent. There were 2748 RCC cases and 27,480 controls. The adjusted ORs for ever vs. never bisphosphonate use were 1.07 (95\% confidence interval: 0.94-1.22) overall; 1.15 (1.00-1.32) for women; and 0.78 (0.54-1.12) for men. Smoking could not be directly controlled for in the analysis. We found a weak association between use of oral bisphosphonates and risk of renal cell carcinoma in females. The observed association could be due to confounding by cigarette smoking, and future studies are required to assess this association further. This article is protected by copyright.

Linear spline multilevel modelling is a useful approach for deriving individual summary measures of growth, which overcomes several data issues (co-linearity of repeat measures, the requirement for all individuals to be measured at the same ages and bias due to missing data). Here, we outline the application of this methodology to model individual trajectories of length/height and weight, drawing on examples from five cohorts from different generations and different geographical regions with varying levels of economic development. We describe the unique features of the data within each cohort that have implications for the application of linear spline multilevel models, for example, differences in the density and inter-individual variation in measurement occasions, and multiple sources of measurement with varying measurement error. After providing example Stata syntax and a suggested workflow for the implementation of linear spline multilevel models, we conclude with a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the linear spline approach compared with other growth modelling methods such as fractional polynomials, more complex spline functions and other non-linear models.},

The instrumental variable (IV) design offers, under certain assumptions, the opportunity to tame confounding bias, without directly observing all confounders. The IV approach is very well developed in the context of linear regression and also for certain generalized linear models with a nonlinear link function. However, IV methods are not as well developed for regression analysis with a censored survival outcome. In this article, we develop the IV approach for regression analysis in a survival context, primarily under an additive hazards model, for which we describe 2 simple methods for estimating causal effects. The first method is a straightforward 2-stage regression approach analogous to 2-stage least squares commonly used for IV analysis in linear regression. In this approach, the fitted value from a first-stage regression of the exposure on the IV is entered in place of the exposure in the second-stage hazard model to recover a valid estimate of the treatment effect of interest. The second method is a so-called control function approach, which entails adding to the additive hazards outcome model, the residual from a first-stage regression of the exposure on the IV. Formal conditions are given justifying each strategy, and the methods are illustrated in a novel application to a Mendelian randomization study to evaluate the effect of diabetes on mortality using data from the Health and Retirement Study. We also establish that analogous strategies can also be used under a proportional hazards model specification, provided the outcome is rare over the entire follow-up.},

The proposed approach is flexible accommodating exposures and IVs of arbitrary type, and enabling covariate adjustment. It makes use of closed-form estimators that can be recursively calculated, and is shown to perform well in simulation studies.

	abstract = {The use of instrumental variables for estimating the effect of an exposure on an outcome is popular in econometrics, and increasingly so in epidemiology. This increasing popularity may be attributed to the natural occurrence of instrumental variables in observational studies that incorporate elements of randomization, either by design or by nature (e.g., random inheritance of genes). Instrumental variables estimation of exposure effects is well established for continuous outcomes and to some extent for binary outcomes. It is, however, largely lacking for time-to-event outcomes because of complications due to censoring and survivorship bias. In this article, we make a novel proposal under a class of structural cumulative survival models which parameterize time-varying effects of a point exposure directly on the scale of the survival function; these models are essentially equivalent with a semi-parametric variant of the instrumental variables additive hazards model. We propose a class of recursive instrumental variable estimators for these exposure effects, and derive their large sample properties along with inferential tools. We examine the performance of the proposed method in simulation studies and illustrate it in a Mendelian randomization study to evaluate the effect of diabetes on mortality using data from the Health and Retirement Study. We further use the proposed method to investigate potential benefit from breast cancer screening on subsequent breast cancer mortality based on the HIP-study.},

Its use in medical literature is still rather limited because of unfamiliarity or inapplicability. By introducing the method in a nontechnical way, we show that IV in a linear model is quite easy to understand and easy to apply once an appropriate instrumental variable has been identified. We also point out some limitations of the IV estimator when the instrumental variable is only weakly correlated with the exposure. The IV estimator will be imprecise (large standard error), biased when sample size is small, and biased in large samples when one of the assumptions is only slightly violated. For these reasons, it is advised to use an IV that is strongly correlated with exposure. However, we further show that under the assumptions required for the validity of the method, this correlation between IV and exposure is limited. Its maximum is low when confounding is strong, such as in case of confounding by indication. Finally, we show that in a study in which strong confounding is to be expected and an IV has been used that is moderately or strongly related to exposure, it is likely that the assumptions of IV are violated, resulting in a biased effect estimate. We conclude that instrumental variables can be useful in case of moderate confounding but are less useful when strong confounding exists, because strong instruments cannot be found and assumptions will be easily violated.},

Using previously published data on proposed preference-based, geography-based, and distance-based instruments, we demonstrate why presenting covariate balance alone can be problematic, and how bias component plots can provide more accurate context for bias from omitting a covariate from an instrumental variable versus non-instrumental variable analysis.

Genetic variants are not subject to bias due to reverse causation (disease processes influencing exposure, rather than vice versa) or recall bias, and if simple precautions are applied, they are not influenced by confounding or attenuation by errors. The principles of Mendelian randomization are illustrated with specific reference to studies of the effects of alcohol intake on various health-related outcomes through the utilization of genetic variants related to alcohol metabolism (in ALDH2 and ADH1B).

However, current developments have largely focused on single mediators because required identification assumptions prohibit simple extensions to settings with multiple mediators that may depend on one another. In this article, we propose a procedure for obtaining fine-grained decompositions that may still be recovered from observed data in such complex settings. We first show that existing analytical approaches target specific instances of a more general set of decompositions and may therefore fail to provide a comprehensive assessment of the processes that underpin cause-effect relationships between exposure and outcome. We then outline conditions for obtaining the remaining set of decompositions. Because the number of targeted decompositions increases rapidly with the number of mediators, we introduce natural effects models along with estimation methods that allow for flexible and parsimonious modeling. Our procedure can easily be implemented using off-the-shelf software and is illustrated using a reanalysis of the World Health Organization's Large Analysis and Review of European Housing and Health Status (WHO-LARES) study on the effect of mold exposure on mental health (2002-2003).},

We describe three families of regression models for the analysis of multilevel survival data. First, Cox proportional hazards models with mixed effects incorporate cluster-specific random effects that modify the baseline hazard function. Second, piecewise exponential survival models partition the duration of follow-up into mutually exclusive intervals and fit a model that assumes that the hazard function is constant within each interval. This is equivalent to a Poisson regression model that incorporates the duration of exposure within each interval. By incorporating cluster-specific random effects, generalised linear mixed models can be used to analyse these data. Third, after partitioning the duration of follow-up into mutually exclusive intervals, one can use discrete time survival models that use a complementary log-log generalised linear model to model the occurrence of the outcome of interest within each interval. Random effects can be incorporated to account for within-cluster homogeneity in outcomes. We illustrate the application of these methods using data consisting of patients hospitalised with a heart attack.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare international trends in pre-eclampsia rates and in overall pregnancy hypertension rates (including gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia). DESIGN: Population data (from birth and/or hospital records) on all women giving birth were available from Australia (two states), Canada (Alberta), Denmark, Norway, Scotland, Sweden and the USA (Massachusetts) for a minimum of 6 years from 1997 to 2007. All countries used the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases, except Massachusetts which used the 9th revision. There were no major changes to the diagnostic criteria or methods of data collection in any country during the study period. Population characteristics as well as rates of pregnancy hypertension and pre-eclampsia were compared. RESULTS: Absolute rates varied across the populations as follows: pregnancy hypertension (3.6\% to 9.1\%), pre-eclampsia (1.4\% to 4.0\%) and early-onset pre-eclampsia (0.3\% to 0.7\%). Pregnancy hypertension and/or pre-eclampsia rates declined over time in most populations. This was unexpected given that factors associated with pregnancy hypertension such as pre-pregnancy obesity and maternal age are generally increasing. However, there was also a downward shift in gestational age with fewer pregnancies reaching 40 weeks. CONCLUSION: The rate of pregnancy hypertension and pre-eclampsia decreased in northern Europe and Australia from 1997 to 2007, but increased in Massachusetts. The use of a different International Classification of Diseases coding version in Massachusetts may contribute to the difference in trend. Elective delivery prior to the due date is the most likely explanation for the decrease observed in Europe and Australia. Also, the use of interventions that reduce the risk of pregnancy hypertension and/or progression to pre-eclampsia (low-dose aspirin, calcium supplementation and early delivery for mild hypertension) may have contributed to the decline.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Women's Health Initiative randomized trial found greater coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in women assigned to estrogen/progestin therapy than in those assigned to placebo. Observational studies had previously suggested reduced CHD risk in hormone users. METHODS: Using data from the observational Nurses' Health Study, we emulated the design and intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of the randomized trial. The observational study was conceptualized as a sequence of "trials," in which eligible women were classified as initiators or noninitiators of estrogen/progestin therapy. RESULTS: The ITT hazard ratios (HRs) (95\% confidence intervals) of CHD for initiators versus noninitiators were 1.42 (0.92-2.20) for the first 2 years, and 0.96 (0.78-1.18) for the entire follow-up. The ITT HRs were 0.84 (0.61-1.14) in women within 10 years of menopause, and 1.12 (0.84-1.48) in the others (P value for interaction = 0.08). These ITT estimates are similar to those from the Women's Health Initiative. Because the ITT approach causes severe treatment misclassification, we also estimated adherence-adjusted effects by inverse probability weighting. The HRs were 1.61 (0.97-2.66) for the first 2 years, and 0.98 (0.66-1.49) for the entire follow-up. The HRs were 0.54 (0.19-1.51) in women within 10 years after menopause, and 1.20 (0.78-1.84) in others (P value for interaction = 0.01). We also present comparisons between these estimates and previously reported Nurses' Health Study estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the discrepancies between the Women's Health Initiative and Nurses' Health Study ITT estimates could be largely explained by differences in the distribution of time since menopause and length of follow-up.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the past 25 years, many pregnancy and birth cohorts have been established. Each cohort provides unique opportunities for examining associations of early-life exposures with child development and health. However, to fully exploit the large amount of available resources and to facilitate cross-cohort collaboration, it is necessary to have accessible information on each cohort and its individual characteristics. The aim of this work was to provide an overview of European pregnancy and birth cohorts registered in a freely accessible database located at http://www.birthcohorts.net. METHODS: European pregnancy and birth cohorts initiated in 1980 or later with at least 300 mother-child pairs enrolled during pregnancy or at birth, and with postnatal data, were eligible for inclusion. Eligible cohorts were invited to provide information on the data and biological samples collected, as well as the timing of data collection. RESULTS: In total, 70 cohorts were identified. Of these, 56 fulfilled the inclusion criteria encompassing a total of more than 500,000 live-born European children. The cohorts represented 19 countries with the majority of cohorts located in Northern and Western Europe. Some cohorts were general with multiple aims, whilst others focused on specific health or exposure-related research questions. CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates a great potential for cross-cohort collaboration addressing important aspects of child health. The web site, http://www.birthcohorts.net, proved to be a useful tool for accessing information on European pregnancy and birth cohorts and their characteristics.},

	abstract = {Triangulation is the practice of obtaining more reliable answers to research questions through integrating results from several different approaches, where each approach has different key sources of potential bias that are unrelated to each other. With respect to causal questions in aetiological epidemiology, if the results of different approaches all point to the same conclusion, this strengthens confidence in the finding. This is particularly the case when the key sources of bias of some of the approaches would predict that findings would point in opposite directions if they were due to such biases. Where there are inconsistencies, understanding the key sources of bias of each approach can help to identify what further research is required to address the causal question. The aim of this paper is to illustrate how triangulation might be used to improve causal inference in aetiological epidemiology. We propose a minimum set of criteria for use in triangulation in aetiological epidemiology, summarize the key sources of bias of several approaches and describe how these might be integrated within a triangulation framework. We emphasize the importance of being explicit about the expected direction of bias within each approach, whenever this is possible, and seeking to identify approaches that would be expected to bias the true causal effect in different directions. We also note the importance, when comparing results, of taking account of differences in the duration and timing of exposures. We provide three examples to illustrate these points.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Changes in health-related behaviour may be a key mechanism linking impaired sleep to poor health, but evidence on this is limited. In this study, we analysed observational data to determine whether onset of impaired sleep is followed by changes in health-related behaviours. METHODS: We used data from 37,508 adults from the longitudinal Finnish Public Sector Study. In analysis of 59 152 person-observations on duration and quality of sleep and health-related behaviours (alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity and weight control), data were treated as a series of non-randomized pseudo-trials with strict predefined criteria for data inclusion and temporality. RESULTS: Smokers who experienced onset of short sleep were less likely to quit smoking than those with persistent normal sleep [odds ratio (OR) = 0.78, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.64-0.97]. Onset of short sleep also predicted initiating high-risk alcohol consumption (OR = 1.17, 95\% CI: 1.00-1.37). Onset of disturbed sleep was associated with changes in all assessed health-related behaviours: initiation of high-risk alcohol consumption (OR = 1.23, 95\% CI: 1.05-1.45), quitting smoking (OR = 0.80, 95\% CI: 0.63-1.00), becoming physically inactive (OR = 1.17, 95\% CI: 1.06-1.30) and becoming overweight or obese (OR = 1.12, 95\% CI: 1.01-1.23). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that the onset of short or disturbed sleep are risk factors for adverse changes in health-related behaviours.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence suggests that vaccines, in addition to their disease-specific effects, have important non-specific effects (NSEs), which contribute to their overall effect on mortality and morbidity. Immunological studies have shown that NSEs are biologically plausible. Many advocate that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with overall mortality or morbidity as the outcome are the only way forward to confirm or refute NSEs. Areas covered: We discuss the limitations of using RCTs only as a tool to evaluate NSEs of vaccines. Such RCTs can be ethically problematic, they are time consuming and expensive. Furthermore, they only assess the NSEs in a given context, but it is inherent in the concept of NSEs that the NSEs of a given vaccine are modified by other immunomodulatory conditions. As an alternative, we propose that triangulation of RCTs and observational studies, merging multiple lines of evidence with different underlying bias structures, can build a strong argument for causality. We examine two examples related to measles vaccine and oral polio vaccine. Expert commentary: Using RCTs alone to evaluate NSEs of vaccines severely limits the possibilities for studying NSEs. Results from both RCTs and non-RCT studies should be triangulated to strengthen causal interpretation.},

However, to estimate the population health effect of a proposed intervention, one may wish to compare factual outcomes under the observed exposure distribution to counterfactual outcomes under the exposure distribution produced by an intervention. Here, we used inverse probability weights to compare the 5-year mortality risk under observed antiretroviral therapy treatment plans to the 5-year mortality risk that would had been observed under an intervention in which all patients initiated therapy immediately upon entry into care among patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus in the US Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems multisite cohort study between 1998 and 2013. Therapy-naive patients (n = 14,700) were followed from entry into care until death, loss to follow-up, or censoring at 5 years or on December 31, 2013. The 5-year cumulative incidence of mortality was 11.65\% under observed treatment plans and 10.10\% under the intervention, yielding a risk difference of -1.57\% (95\% confidence interval: -3.08, -0.06). Comparing outcomes under the intervention with outcomes under observed treatment plans provides meaningful information about the potential consequences of new US guidelines to treat all patients with human immunodeficiency virus regardless of CD4 cell count under actual clinical conditions.},

Patients and methods: Data from resected PCa patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2014 and registered in the national cancer registries of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Slovenia were used to estimate the association between ACT and overall survival using a Cox proportional hazards model by country and overall. Results derived from the immortal time bias (misclassifying the time to ACT initiation), Mantel-Byar method, and conventional and modified landmark analyses with assumed cutoff times of ACT initiation at 9, 12 and 15 weeks post-diagnosis were compared. Results: In total, 5,668 patients with a total of 10,921 person-years of follow-up were eligible. All analytical approaches showed a significant survival benefit for resected PCa patients who received ACT, but immortal time bias analyses led to strong overestimation of ACT benefits compared to the Mantel-Byar method (immortal time bias: overall HR [95\% CI] 0.68 [0.62-0.75] vs Mantel-Byar method: 0.82 [0.71-0.93]), whereas the conventional landmark approach generally provided rather conservative estimates (0.86 [0.75-1.00], 15 weeks landmark). HRs derived from modified landmark analyses depended on the cutoff time, but were similar compared to the Mantel-Byar method at 15 weeks (0.81 [0.70-0.94]). Conclusion: A modified landmark approach might be a valid alternative to the Mantel-Byar method if no time of treatment information is available. The performance depends on the chosen cutoff time.},

	abstract = {Observational comparative effectiveness and safety studies are often subject to immortal person-time, a period of follow-up during which outcomes cannot occur because of the treatment definition. Common approaches, like excluding immortal time from the analysis or naively including immortal time in the analysis, are known to result in biased estimates of treatment effect. Other approaches, such as the Mantel-Byar and landmark methods, have been proposed to handle immortal time. Little is known about the performance of the landmark method in different scenarios. We conducted extensive Monte Carlo simulations to assess the performance of the landmark method compared with other methods in settings that reflect realistic scenarios. We considered four landmark times for the landmark method. We found that the Mantel-Byar method provided unbiased estimates in all scenarios, whereas the exclusion and naive methods resulted in substantial bias when the hazard of the event was constant or decreased over time. The landmark method performed well in correcting immortal person-time bias in all scenarios when the treatment effect was small, and provided unbiased estimates when there was no treatment effect. The bias associated with the landmark method tended to be small when the treatment rate was higher in the early follow-up period than it was later. These findings were confirmed in a case study of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on the associations between untreated and treated maternal hypertension and the risk of CHDs, evaluating CHDs overall as well as specific CHD subtypes. A systematic search of peer-reviewed articles published before August 2013 identified 16 studies evaluating the associations between untreated and treated maternal hypertension and CHDs. Summary relative risk (RR) estimates were calculated using fixed-effects models and random-effects models. Significant associations were observed between maternal hypertension and overall CHDs, for both treated [RR 2.0; 95 \% confidence interval (CI) 1.5, 2.7] and untreated (RR 1.4; 95 \% CI 1.2, 1.7) hypertension, as well as for overall hypertension regardless of treatment status (RR 1.8; 95 \% CI 1.5, 2.2). The magnitude of effect was similar for the majority of CHD subtypes evaluated. The effects were also similar among women with hypertension who used one of multiple specific hypertension medications. There was no evidence of publication bias, and our results were robust to several factors considered in sensitivity analyses (e.g., source of exposure data, adjustment for potential confounders, and study design). Maternal hypertension was associated with CHDs. By understanding the specific mechanisms involved, appropriate strategies may be developed to reduce this risk, in order to prevent CHDs.},

The purpose of the study was to examine the association between maternal chronic hypertension and the risk of congenital malformations in the offspring. STUDY DESIGN: We defined a cohort of 878,126 completed pregnancies linked to infant medical records using the Medicaid Analytic Extract. The risk of congenital malformations was compared between normotensive controls and those with treated and untreated chronic hypertension. Confounding was addressed using propensity score matching. RESULTS: After matching, compared with normotensive controls, pregnancies complicated by treated chronic hypertension were at increased risk of congenital malformations (odds ratio [OR], 1.3; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-1.5), as were pregnancies with untreated chronic hypertension (OR 1.2; 95\% CI, 1.1-1.3). In our analysis of organ-specific malformations, both treated and untreated chronic hypertension was associated with a significant increase in the risk of cardiac malformations (OR, 1.6; 95\% CI, 1.4-1.9 and OR, 1.5; 95\% CI, 1.3-1.7, respectively). These associations persisted across a range of sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: There is a similar increase in the risk of congenital malformations (particularly cardiac malformations) associated with treated and untreated chronic hypertension that is independent of measured confounders. Studies evaluating the teratogenic potential of antihypertensive medications must control for confounding by indication. Fetuses and neonates of mothers with chronic hypertension should be carefully evaluated for potential malformations, particularly cardiac defects.},

	abstract = {It is well known that the odds ratio is noncollapsible, in the sense that conditioning on a covariate that is related to the outcome typically changes the size of the odds ratio, even if this covariate is unrelated to the exposure. The risk difference and risk ratio do not have this peculiar property; we say that the risk difference and risk ratio are collapsible. However, noncollapsibility is not unique for the odds ratio; the rate difference and rate ratio are generally noncollapsible as well. This may seem paradoxical, since the rate can be viewed as a risk per unit time, and thus one would naively suspect that the rate difference/ratio should inherit collapsibility from the risk difference/ratio. Adding to the confusion, it was recently shown that the exposure coefficient in the Aalen additive hazards model is collapsible. This may seem to contradict the fact that the rate difference is generally noncollapsible, since the exposure coefficient in the Aalen additive hazards model is a rate difference. In this article, we use graphical arguments to explain why the rate difference/ratio does not inherit collapsibility from the risk difference/ratio. We also explain when and why the exposure coefficient in the Aalen additive hazards model is collapsible.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many investigators write as if non-differential exposure misclassification inevitably leads to a reduction in the strength of an estimated exposure-disease association. Unfortunately, non-differentiality alone is insufficient to guarantee bias towards the null. Furthermore, because bias refers to the average estimate across study repetitions rather than the result of a single study, bias towards the null is insufficient to guarantee that an observed estimate will be an underestimate. Thus, as noted before, exposure misclassification can spuriously increase the observed strength of an association even when the misclassification process is non-differential and the bias it produced is towards the null. METHODS: We present additional results on this topic, including a simulation study of how often an observed relative risk is an overestimate of the true relative risk when the bias is towards the null. RESULTS: The frequency of overestimation depends on many factors: the value of the true relative risk, exposure prevalence, baseline (unexposed) risk, misclassification rates, and other factors that influence bias and random error. CONCLUSIONS: Non-differentiality of exposure misclassification does not justify claims that the observed estimate must be an underestimate; further conditions must hold to get bias towards the null, and even when they do hold the observed estimate may by chance be an overestimate.},

	abstract = {Importance: Interpregnancy intervals shorter than 18 months are associated with higher risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes. It is currently unknown whether short intervals are associated with increased risks among older women to the same extent as among younger women. Objective: To evaluate whether the association between short interpregnancy (delivery to conception) interval and adverse pregnancy outcomes is modified by maternal age. Design, Setting, and Participants: A population-based cohort study conducted in British Columbia, Canada, evaluated women with 2 or more singleton pregnancies from 2004 to 2014 with the first (index) pregnancy resulting in a live birth. Data analysis was performed from January 1 to July 20, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risks of maternal mortality or severe morbidity (eg, mechanical ventilation, blood transfusion {\textgreater}3 U, intensive care unit admission, organ failure, death), small-for-gestational age ({\textless}10th birthweight percentile for gestational age and sex), fetal and infant composite outcome (stillbirth, infant death, {\textless}third birthweight percentile for gestational age and sex, delivery {\textless}28 weeks), and spontaneous and indicated preterm delivery. Risks of each outcome for 3- to 24-month interpregnancy intervals were estimated, according to maternal age at index birth (20-34 and {\textgreater}/=35 years). Adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) comparing predicted risks at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month intervals with risks at 18-month intervals for each age group were calculated. The potential role of other factors explaining any differences (unmeasured confounding) was examined in several sensitivity analyses. Results: Among 148544 pregnancies, maternal mortality or severe morbidity risks were increased at 6-month compared with 18-month interpregnancy intervals for women aged 35 years or older (0.62\% at 6 months vs 0.26\% at 18 months; aRR, 2.39; 95\% CI, 2.03-2.80), but not for women aged 20 to 34 years (0.23\% at 6 months vs 0.25\% at 18 months; aRR, 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.83-1.02). Increased adverse fetal and infant outcome risks were more pronounced for women aged 20 to 34 years (2.0\% at 6 months vs 1.4\% at 18 months; aRR, 1.42; 95\% CI, 1.36-1.47) than women 35 years or older (2.1\% at 6 months vs 1.8\% at 18 months; aRR, 1.15; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.31). Risks of spontaneous preterm delivery at 6-month interpregnancy intervals were increased for women 20 to 34 years old (5.3\% at 6 months vs 3.2\% at 18 months; aRR, 1.65; 95\% CI, 1.62-1.68) and to a lesser extent for women 35 years or older (5.0\% at 6 months vs 3.6\% at 18 months; aRR, 1.40; 95\% CI, 1.31-1.49). Modest increases in risks of small-for-gestational age and indicated preterm delivery at short intervals did not vary meaningfully by maternal age. Sensitivity analyses suggested that observed associations were not fully explained by unmeasured confounding. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that short interpregnancy intervals are associated with increased risks for adverse pregnancy outcomes for women of all ages.},

METHODS: Vital records data were linked to cancer registry diagnosis and treatment information in 3 US states. Women who conceived their first pregnancy after diagnosis between ages 20 and 45 years with any invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ were eligible. Log-binomial models were used to compare risks in cancer survivors who conceived in each interval to the risks in matched comparison births to women without cancer. RESULTS: Women who conceived {\textless}/=1 year after starting chemotherapy for any cancer had higher risks of preterm birth than comparison women (chemotherapy alone: relative risk [RR], 1.9; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-2.7; chemotherapy with radiation: RR, 2.4; 95\% CI, 1.6-3.6); women who conceived {\textgreater}/=1 year after starting chemotherapy without radiation or {\textgreater}/=2 years after chemotherapy with radiation did not. In analyses imputing the treatment end date for breast cancer survivors, those who conceived {\textgreater}/=1 year after finishing chemotherapy with or without radiation had no higher risks than women without cancer. The risk of preterm birth in cervical cancer survivors largely persisted but was somewhat lower in pregnancies conceived after the first year (for pregnancies conceived {\textless}/=1 year after diagnosis: RR, 3.5; 95\% CI, 2.2-5.4; for pregnancies conceived {\textgreater}1 year after diagnosis: RR, 2.4; 95\% CI, 1.6-3.5).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Time-to-event modelling is underutilised in sports injury research. Still, sports injury researchers have been encouraged to consider time-to-event analyses as a powerful alternative to other statistical methods. Therefore, it is important to shed light on statistical approaches suitable for analysing training load related key-questions within the sports injury domain. CONTENT: In the present article, we illuminate: (i) the possibilities of including time-varying outcomes in time-to-event analyses, (ii) how to deal with a situation where different types of sports injuries are included in the analyses (ie, competing risks), and (iii) how to deal with the situation where multiple subsequent injuries occur in the same athlete. CONCLUSION: Time-to-event analyses can handle time-varying outcomes, competing risk and multiple subsequent injuries. Although powerful, time-to-event has important requirements: researchers are encouraged to carefully consider prior to any data collection that five injuries per exposure state or transition is needed to avoid conducting statistical analyses on time-to-event data leading to biased results. This requirement becomes particularly difficult to accommodate when a stratified analysis is required as the number of variables increases exponentially for each additional strata included. In future sports injury research, we need stratified analyses if the target of our research is to respond to the question: 'how much change in training load is too much before injury is sustained, among athletes with different characteristics?' Responding to this question using multiple time-varying exposures (and outcomes) requires millions of injuries. This should not be a barrier for future research, but collaborations across borders to collecting the amount of data needed seems to be an important step forward.},

Very few studies have included time-varying exposures (eg, training load) and time-varying effect-measure modifiers (eg, previous injury, biomechanics, sleep/stress) when studying sports injury aetiology. AIM: To discuss advanced statistical methods suitable for the complex analysis of time-varying exposures such as changes in training load and injury-related outcomes. CONTENT: Time-varying exposures and time-varying effect-measure modifiers can be used in time-to-event models to investigate sport injury aetiology. We address four key-questions (i) Does time-to-event modelling allow change in training load to be included as a time-varying exposure for sport injury development? (ii) Why is time-to-event analysis superior to other analytical concepts when analysing training-load related data that changes status over time? (iii) How can researchers include change in training load in a time-to-event analysis? and, (iv) Are researchers able to include other time-varying variables into time-to-event analyses? We emphasise that cleaning datasets, setting up the data, performing analyses with time-varying variables and interpreting the results is time-consuming, and requires dedication. It may need you to ask for assistance from methodological peers as the analytical approaches presented this paper require specialist knowledge and well-honed statistical skills. CONCLUSION: To increase knowledge about the association between changes in training load and injury, we encourage sports injury researchers to collaborate with statisticians and/or methodological epidemiologists to carefully consider applying time-to-event models to prospective sports injury data. This will ensure appropriate interpretation of time-to-event data.},

	abstract = {Propensity score methods are increasingly being used to reduce or minimize the effects of confounding when estimating the effects of treatments, exposures, or interventions when using observational or non-randomized data. Under the assumption of no unmeasured confounders, previous research has shown that propensity score methods allow for unbiased estimation of linear treatment effects (e.g., differences in means or proportions). However, in biomedical research, time-to-event outcomes occur frequently. There is a paucity of research into the performance of different propensity score methods for estimating the effect of treatment on time-to-event outcomes. Furthermore, propensity score methods allow for the estimation of marginal or population-average treatment effects. We conducted an extensive series of Monte Carlo simulations to examine the performance of propensity score matching (1:1 greedy nearest-neighbor matching within propensity score calipers), stratification on the propensity score, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score, and covariate adjustment using the propensity score to estimate marginal hazard ratios. We found that both propensity score matching and IPTW using the propensity score allow for the estimation of marginal hazard ratios with minimal bias. Of these two approaches, IPTW using the propensity score resulted in estimates with lower mean squared error when estimating the effect of treatment in the treated. Stratification on the propensity score and covariate adjustment using the propensity score result in biased estimation of both marginal and conditional hazard ratios. Applied researchers are encouraged to use propensity score matching and IPTW using the propensity score when estimating the relative effect of treatment on time-to-event outcomes.},

For each of the latter two algorithms, we examined four different sub-algorithms defined by the order in which treated subjects were selected for matching to an untreated subject: lowest to highest propensity score, highest to lowest propensity score, best match first, and random order. We also examined matching with replacement. We found that (i) nearest neighbor matching induced the same balance in baseline covariates as did optimal matching; (ii) when at least some of the covariates were continuous, caliper matching tended to induce balance on baseline covariates that was at least as good as the other algorithms; (iii) caliper matching tended to result in estimates of treatment effect with less bias compared with optimal and nearest neighbor matching; (iv) optimal and nearest neighbor matching resulted in estimates of treatment effect with negligibly less variability than did caliper matching; (v) caliper matching had amongst the best performance when assessed using mean squared error; (vi) the order in which treated subjects were selected for matching had at most a modest effect on estimation; and (vii) matching with replacement did not have superior performance compared with caliper matching without replacement.},

We also assessed the prevalence of misinterpretation of the HR. Patients and methods: We performed a randomized experiment. We selected 15 cancer RCTs with statistically significant treatment effects for the primary outcome. We masked each abstract and created 3 versions reporting either the HR, RMSTD, or HR+RMSTD. We randomized corresponding authors of RCTs and medical residents and fellows to one of 15 abstracts and one of 3 versions. We asked how beneficial the experimental treatment was (0 to 10 Likert scale). All participants answered a multiple-choice question about interpretation of the HR. Participants were unaware of the study purpose. Results: We randomly allocated 160 participants to evaluate an abstract reporting the HR, 154 to the RMSTD, and 155 to both HR+RMSTD. The mean Likert score was statistically significantly lower in the RMSTD group as compared with the HR group (mean difference -0.8, 95\% confidence interval, -1.3 to -0.4, p {\textless} 0.01) and as compared with the HR+RMSTD group (difference -0.6, -1.1 to -0.1, p = 0.05). In all, 47.2\% (42.7\% to 51.8\%) of participants misinterpreted the HR, with 40\% equating it with a reduction in absolute risk. Conclusion: Misinterpretation of the HR is common. Participants judged experimental treatments to be less beneficial when presented with RMSTD as compared with HR. We recommend that authors present RMST-based measures alongside the HR in reports of RCT results.},

	abstract = {Causal inference for non-censored response variables, such as binary or quantitative outcomes, is often based on either (1) direct standardization ('G-formula') or (2) inverse probability of treatment assignment weights ('propensity score'). To do causal inference in survival analysis, one needs to address right-censoring, and often, special techniques are required for that purpose. We will show how censoring can be dealt with 'once and for all' by means of so-called pseudo-observations when doing causal inference in survival analysis. The pseudo-observations can be used as a replacement of the outcomes without censoring when applying 'standard' causal inference methods, such as (1) or (2) earlier. We study this idea for estimating the average causal effect of a binary treatment on the survival probability, the restricted mean lifetime, and the cumulative incidence in a competing risks situation. The methods will be illustrated in a small simulation study and via a study of patients with acute myeloid leukemia who received either myeloablative or non-myeloablative conditioning before allogeneic hematopoetic cell transplantation. We will estimate the average causal effect of the conditioning regime on outcomes such as the 3-year overall survival probability and the 3-year risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease.

This study assessed the association between such pregnancy-related experiences and the subsequent risk of female predominant and other ADs. Our study cohort comprised 1.6 million Danish women born since 1955 for whom we had information about hyperemesis, gestational hypertensive disorders and pregnancy losses and subsequent hospital contacts for 31 ADs between 1982 and 2008. Ratios of first hospitalization rates (RRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Poisson regression, adjusting for age, birth cohort, calendar period, marital status and childbirths. During 27.0 million person-years of follow-up 51,732 women were hospitalized with one or more ADs. Overall, compared with women without the specific pregnancy experiences, the risk of any AD was significantly increased for women with hyperemesis (RR = 1.41; 95\% CI 1.30-1.51), gestational hypertensive disorders (1.21; 1.16-1.26), spontaneous abortions (1.10; 1.07-1.14), missed abortions (1.09; 1.04-1.13), stillbirths (1.25; 1.12-1.40), ectopic pregnancies (1.08; 1.02-1.14) and induced abortions (1.07; 1.04-1.09). Associations with female predominant ADs (i.e., ADs with a female:male ratio {\textgreater}2:1) were strongest in the first five years after the studied pregnancy experiences, but overall there was little difference between the RRs for groups of female predominant ADs and other ADs. Strong and potentially biological associations were observed for a number of specific ADs; including systemic lupus erythematosus, Graves' disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus and pernicious anemia, and for some specific ADs associations persisted even more than five years after the abnormal pregnancy experience. Abnormal pregnancies are associated with increased risk of certain ADs, possibly because of underlying immunologic or hormonal factors that predispose to both adverse pregnancy experiences and AD development.},

	abstract = {This review highlights factors of importance for the clinical care of pregnant women with pregestational diabetes and microalbuminuria or diabetic nephropathy with particular focus on the role of intensive antihypertensive treatment during pregnancy. Most information in the literature comes from women with type 1 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy, but this is probably also valid for women with type 2 diabetes. Careful counseling of women with diabetic nephropathy before pregnancy with estimation of the risk for the mother and fetus is important. Pregnancy does not result in worsening of kidney function in women with diabetic nephropathy and normal serum creatinine, but pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery are common. Intensive metabolic control before and during pregnancy, low-dose aspirin from 12 gestational weeks onward, and intensive antihypertensive treatment are important. Methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine are regarded safe in pregnancy, whereas angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, AngII antagonists, or statins should be paused before pregnancy. Case series and pathophysiological studies support the use of a stringent goal for BP and albumin excretion in pregnant women with diabetic nephropathy. Screening for diabetic retinopathy before and during pregnancy is mandatory and laser treatment should be performed if indicated. Pregnancy outcome in women with diabetic nephropathy has improved considerably with a take-home-baby rate of approximately 95\%. Further research on the benefits and risks of intensive antihypertensive treatment in this population is needed.},

METHODS: In an unselected cohort of 1909 pregnant women, sFlt-1 and PlGF were measured with KRYPTOR assays in gestational weeks (GW) 8-14 and 20-34. Associations to PE were assessed by receiver operating characteristics and logistic regression. RESULTS: Concentrations of sFlt-1, PlGF, and sFlt-1/PlGF in GW20-34 were predictive of PE development, but not in GW8-14. PlGF outperformed sFlt-1/PlGF ratio with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.755 vs. 0.704, p = 0.002. The highest AUC values for PlGF and sFlt-1/PlGF ratio were seen for severe early-onset PE (0.901 and 0.883). Negative predictive values were high for all PE types, but positive predictive values were low. CONCLUSION: PlGF and sFlt-1/PlGF had good predictive value for PE at GW20-34 in a population-based unselected cohort, however with low positive predictive value.},

Whether hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are also associated with cardiomyopathy later in life is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with cardiomyopathy beyond the peripartum period. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Nationwide register-based cohort study using Cox regression to compare rates of cardiomyopathy in women with and without a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in a cohort of 1,075,763 women with at least 1 pregnancy ending in live birth or stillbirth in Denmark, 1978-2012, with follow-up through December 31, 2012. EXPOSURES: A hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (severe or moderate preeclampsia or gestational hypertension) registered in the National Patient Register. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cardiomyopathy more than 5 months after delivery (outside the peripartum period) up to 34 years 7 months. RESULT: The women in the primary cohort had 2,067,633 eligible pregnancies during the study period, 76,108 of which were complicated by a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. During follow-up, 1577 women (mean age, 48.5 years at cardiomyopathy diagnosis; 2.6\% with multiple pregnancies) developed cardiomyopathy. Compared with women with normotensive pregnancies (18,211,603 person-years of follow-up; n = 1408 cardiomyopathy events, 7.7/100,000 person-years [95\% CI, 7.3-8.2]), women with a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy had significantly increased rates of cardiomyopathy (in 173,062 person-years of follow-up among women with severe preeclampsia, n = 27 cardiomyopathy events; 15.6/100,000 person-years [95\% CI, 10.7-22.7]; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.20 [95\% CI, 1.50-3.23]; in 697,447 person-years of follow-up among women with moderate preeclampsia, n = 102 cardiomyopathy events; 14.6/100,000 person-years [95\% CI, 12.0-17.8]; adjusted HR, 1.89 [95\% CI, 1.55-2.23]; in 213,197 person-years of follow-up among women with gestational hypertension, n = 40 cardiomyopathy events; 17.3/100,000 person-years [95\% CI, 12.7-23.6]; adjusted HR, 2.06 [95\% CI, 1.50-2.82]). These increases persisted more than 5 years after the latest pregnancy. Mediation analyses suggested that only about 50\% of the association was an indirect association through postpregnancy chronic hypertension. In this cohort, 11\% of all cardiomyopathy events occurred in women with a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Women with a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, compared with women without such a history, had a small but statistically significant increased risk of cardiomyopathy more than 5 months after delivery. Further research is necessary to understand whether there is a causal mechanism behind this association.},

Several epidemiological studies have been performed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of HDP as well as its subtypes. The prevalences of HDP, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia are 5.2-8.2\%, 1.8-4.4\% and 0.2-9.2\%, respectively. Body mass index, anemia and lower education appear to be modifiable risk factors for HDP. Maternal age, primiparous, multiple pregnancy, HDP in previous pregnancy, gestational diabetes mellitus, preexisting hypertension, preexisting type 2 diabetes mellitus, preexisting urinary tract infection and a family history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and preeclampsia appear to be nonmodifiable risk factors. Genetic variants including a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the angiotensinogen gene have also been reported to be nonmodifiable risk factors. Epidemiological studies have recently examined the associations between a history of HDP and its subtypes and future risks of other diseases. These studies have reported associations between a history of HDP and a risk of coronary heart disease, heart failure, dysrhythmia, stroke, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal dysfunction and cardiomyopathy. HDP is not associated with the future incidence of total cancer. In conclusion, HDP is not a rare complication of pregnancy and the influence of HDP remains for an extended duration. Physicians should consider the effects of HDP when treating chronic diseases in women.},

We hypothesized that a preconception history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is associated with increased risk of placenta-mediated pregnancy complications. METHODS: A nationwide population-based cohort study of all singleton pregnancies leading to delivery from 1997 to 2012 (n = 964 967). We obtained data on placenta-mediated pregnancy complications from the Danish Medical Birth Registry and data on VTE before pregnancy from the Danish National Patient Registry. We computed absolute risks, crude and adjusted risk differences (RDs) using a binomial regression model, and crude and adjusted risk ratios (RRs) from a modified Poisson regression model. RESULTS: Overall, 1419 women had a preconception history of VTE, while 578 112 did not. Preeclampsia occurred in 4.2\% of pregnancies in the VTE group and in 2.7\% of pregnancies in a comparison cohort (adjusted RD = 1.3\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.6-2.0\%; adjusted RR = 1.5, 95\% CI 1.3-1.8).

A total of 21 of 2,951 women without preeclampsia (0.71\%) had a preeclampsia diagnosis in the registry. All registrations of serious subtypes of preeclampsia reflected true cases. The positive predictive value of a preeclampsia diagnosis in the registry was 74.4\%. Including interview data reduced the sample size to 2,307 women. In this sample, of 62 women with preeclampsia, 45 (72.6\%) reported in the interview to have had preeclampsia. Of 2,245 women with no preeclampsia, 31 (1.4\%) reported to have had preeclampsia. The positive predictive value of the women's own report on preeclampsia was 59.2\%.

Changes in diagnostic criteria and underreporting in certain subsets of patients may hamper validity of the diagnoses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We validated the discharge diagnoses of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension, which are reported to the Danish National Patient Registry, in a cohort of 2163 pregnant women by retrospective evaluation of electronic hospital data. RESULTS: A preeclampsia discharge diagnosis was found in 113 (5.2\%) of the participants. After validation, significantly more patients fulfilled criteria for diagnosis of preeclampsia (n = 163, 7.5\%, p = 0.002); more had severe preeclampsia, 14 (0.6\%) vs. 70 (3.2\%), p {\textless} 0.001 and gestational hypertension, 62 (2.9\%) vs. 46 (2.1\%), p = 0.12. The diagnostic sensitivity for preeclampsia by discharge diagnosis was 55.8\%; severe preeclampsia 18.6\%; gestational hypertension 39.1\%. Corresponding positive predictive values were 80.5, 92.9 and 29.0\%. Misclassification occurred in 4.3, 2.7 and 3.3\%, respectively. Misclassification was more prevalent in obese compared to lean women (10\% vs. 3.6\%, p {\textless} 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Discharge diagnoses substantially underestimated the prevalence of preeclampsia, especially severe preeclampsia. Misclassification was most common in obese preeclamptic women. These findings depict the limitations associated with the direct use of discharge diagnoses of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy for research purposes.},

	abstract = {A frequent occurrence in medical research is that a patient is subject to different causes of failure, where each cause is known as a competing risk. The cumulative incidence curve is a proper summary curve, showing the cumulative failure rates over time due to a particular cause. A common question in medical research is to assess the covariate effects on a cumulative incidence function. The standard approach is to construct regression models for all cause-specific hazard rate functions and then model a covariate-adjusted cumulative incidence curve as a function of all cause-specific hazards for a given set of covariates. New methods have been proposed in recent years, emphasizing direct assessment of covariate effects on cumulative incidence function. Fine and Gray proposed modeling the effects of covariates on a subdistribution hazard function. A different approach is to directly model a covariate-adjusted cumulative incidence function, including a pseudovalue approach by Andersen and Klein and a direct binomial regression by Scheike, Zhang and Gerds. In this paper, we review the standard and new regression methods for modeling a cumulative incidence function, and give the sources of computer packages/programs that implement these regression models. A real bone marrow transplant data set is analyzed to illustrate various regression methods.},

Higher titers of IL-6 were associated with lower averaging albumin levels within 1(st) year of PD. Increasing numbers of these risk markers of mortality was associated with decreasing survival advantages (P = 0.001).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients with acute renal failure (ARF) experience a high mortality rate. Animal and human studies suggest that proinflammatory cytokines lead to the development of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which is temporally followed by a counter anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS). This process has not been specifically described in critically ill patients with ARF. METHODS: The Program to Improve Care in Acute Renal Disease (PICARD) is a prospective, multicenter cohort study designed to examine the natural history, practice patterns, and outcomes of treatment in critically ill patients with ARF. In a subset of 98 patients with ARF, we measured plasma proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)], the acute-phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP), and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 at study enrollment and over the course of illness. RESULTS: When compared with healthy subjects and end-stage renal disease patients on maintenance hemodialysis, patients with ARF had significantly higher plasma levels of all measured cytokines. Additionally, the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly higher in nonsurvivors versus survivors [median 234.7 (interdecile range 64.8 to 1775.9) pg/mL vs. 113.5 (46.1 to 419.3) pg/mL, P= 0.02 for IL-6; 35.5 (14.1 to 237.9) pg/mL vs. 21.2 (8.5 to 87.1) pg/mL, P= 0.03 for IL-8]. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was also significantly higher in nonsurvivors [3.1 (0.5 to 41.9) pg/mL vs. 2.4 (0.5 to 16.9) pg/mL, P= 0.04]. For each natural log unit increase in the levels of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, the odds of death increased by 65\%, 54\%, and 34\%, respectively, corresponding to increases in relative risk of approximately 30\%, 25\%, and 15\%. The presence or absence of SIRS or sepsis was not a major determinant of plasma cytokine concentration in this group of patients. CONCLUSION: There is evidence of ongoing SIRS with concomitant CARS in critically ill patients with ARF, with higher levels of plasma IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 in patients with ARF who die during hospitalization. Strategies to modulate inflammation must take into account the complex cytokine biology in patients with established ARF.},

A key difference between previously described time-varying confounding and the proposed time-modified confounding is that, in the former, the values of the confounding variable change over time while, in the latter, the effects of the confounder change over time. Using marginal structural models, the authors propose an approach to account for time-modified confounding when the relation between the confounder and treatment is modified over time. An illustrative example and simulation show that, when time-modified confounding is present, a marginal structural model with inverse probability-of-treatment weights specified to account for time-modified confounding remains approximately unbiased with appropriate confidence limit coverage, while models that do not account for time-modified confounding are biased. Correct specification of the treatment model, including accounting for potential variation over time in confounding, is an important assumption of marginal structural models. When the effect of confounders on either the treatment or outcome changes over time, time-modified confounding should be considered.},

METHOD OF STUDY: Seventy-five sub-fertile women with Th1/Th2 cytokine elevation were divided into four groups: Group I: Forty-one patients using both IVIG and Adalimumab (Humira), Group II: Twenty-three patients using IVIG, Group III: Six patients using Humira, and Group IV: Five patients using no IVIG or Humira. RESULTS: The implantation rate (number of gestational sacs per embryo transferred, with an average of two embryos transferred by cycle) was 59\% (50/85), 47\% (21/45), 31\% (4/13) and 0\% (0/9) for groups I, II, III and IV respectively.

Although the sequential patterns of aging cannot be changed, several age-related factors that contribute to disease risk can be. For most adults, age is coincidentally associated with preventable chronic conditions, avoidable exposures, and modifiable risk behaviors that are causally associated with cancer. Midlife is a period of life when the prevalence of multiple cancer risk factors is high and incidence rates begin to increase for many types of cancer. However, current evidence suggests that for most adults, cancer does not have to be an inevitable consequence of growing older. Interventions that support healthy environments, help people manage chronic conditions, and promote healthy behaviors may help people make a healthier transition from midlife to older age and reduce the likelihood of developing cancer. Because the number of adults reaching older ages is increasing rapidly, the number of new cancer cases will also increase if current incidence rates remain unchanged. Thus, the need to translate the available research into practice to promote cancer prevention, especially for adults at midlife, has never been greater.},

In this article we considered these 2 options in terms of their ability to detect a treatment effect in time-to-event studies. Our investigation shows that a Cox regression model applied to the entire cohort is often a more powerful tool in detecting treatment effect as compared with a matched study.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may share genetic and environmental risk factors. We examined whether parental IBD is associated with an increased risk of ASD in offspring. METHODS: We conducted a registry-based nationwide cohort study including children born alive in Denmark from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 2009, with follow-up throughout 2010. IBD in parents and ASD in offspring were identified using inpatient and outpatient hospital diagnoses. We computed risk of ASD and crude and adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) using Cox proportional-hazards regression. We evaluated the risk of ASD according to maternal and paternal IBD, and separately for maternal and paternal Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Children with parents free of IBD were the comparison cohort. RESULTS: We identified 1,005,330 children during the study period. Among them, 11,888 (1.2\%) had a parent with IBD and 8,087 (0.8\%) had a diagnosis of ASD during up to 17 years of follow-up. The 10-year risks of ASD were 0.7\% among children of parents with IBD and 0.9\% among children of parents without IBD. The aIRR for ASD among children with parental IBD was 0.8 (95\% CI: 0.6-1.0), and results were similar regardless of parent of IBD origin or whether a parent had CD or UC. The estimates were similar for different ASD subtypes. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence of an increased risk of ASD among children born to parents with IBD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Separate multivariable risk algorithms are commonly used to assess risk of specific atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, ie, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and heart failure. The present report presents a single multivariable risk function that predicts risk of developing all CVD and of its constituents. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used Cox proportional-hazards regression to evaluate the risk of developing a first CVD event in 8491 Framingham study participants (mean age, 49 years; 4522 women) who attended a routine examination between 30 and 74 years of age and were free of CVD. Sex-specific multivariable risk functions ("general CVD" algorithms) were derived that incorporated age, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, treatment for hypertension, smoking, and diabetes status. We assessed the performance of the general CVD algorithms for predicting individual CVD events (coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or heart failure). Over 12 years of follow-up, 1174 participants (456 women) developed a first CVD event. All traditional risk factors evaluated predicted CVD risk (multivariable-adjusted P{\textless}0.0001). The general CVD algorithm demonstrated good discrimination (C statistic, 0.763 [men] and 0.793 [women]) and calibration. Simple adjustments to the general CVD risk algorithms allowed estimation of the risks of each CVD component. Two simple risk scores are presented, 1 based on all traditional risk factors and the other based on non-laboratory-based predictors. CONCLUSIONS: A sex-specific multivariable risk factor algorithm can be conveniently used to assess general CVD risk and risk of individual CVD events (coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial disease and heart failure). The estimated absolute CVD event rates can be used to quantify risk and to guide preventive care.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Recent observational studies suggest that various drugs are remarkably effective at reducing morbidity and mortality. These cohort studies used a flawed approach to design and data analysis which can lead to immortal time bias. We describe the bias from 20 of these studies and illustrate it by showing that unrelated drugs can be made to appear effective at treating cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: The illustration used a cohort of 3315 patients, with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), identified from the Saskatchewan Health databases, hospitalised for CVD and followed for up to a year. We used the biased approach to assess the effect of two medications, namely gastrointestinal drugs (GID) and inhaled beta-agonists (IBA), both unknown to be effective in CVD, on the risk of all-cause mortality. We also estimated these effects using the proper person-time approach. RESULTS: Using the inappropriate approach, the rates ratios of all-cause death were 0.73 (95\%CI: 0.57-0.93), with IBA and 0.78 (95\%CI: 0.61-0.99), with GID. These rate ratios became 0.98 (95\%CI: 0.77-1.25) and 0.94 (95\%CI: 0.73-1.20), respectively, with the proper person-time analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Several recent observational studies used a flawed approach to design and data analysis, leading to immortal time bias, which can generate an illusion of treatment effectiveness. Observational studies, with surprising beneficial drug effects should be re-assessed to account for this source of bias.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To illustrate the application of relative survival to observational studies in coronary heart disease (CHD) and potential advantages compared with all-cause survival methods. Survival after myocardial infarction (MI) is generally assessed using all-cause or cause-specific methods. Neither method is able to assess the impact of the disease or condition of interest in comparison with expected survival in a similar population. Relative survival, the ratio of the observed and the expected survival rates, is applied routinely in cancer studies and may improve on current methods for assessment of survival in CHD. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a cohort of subjects after a first recorded acute MI, we discuss the application of relative survival in CHD and illustrate a number of the key issues. We compare the findings from relative survival with those obtained using Cox proportional and non-proportional hazards models in standard all-cause survival. Estimated survival rates are higher using relative survival models compared with all-cause methods. CONCLUSION: Estimates obtained from all-cause mortality fail to disentangle mortality associated with the condition of interest from that due to all other causes. Relative survival gives an estimate of survival due to the disease of interest without the need for cause of death information.},

	abstract = {The potential for guarantee-time bias (GTB), also known as immortal time bias, exists whenever an analysis that is timed from enrollment or random assignment, such as disease-free or overall survival, is compared across groups defined by a classifying event occurring sometime during follow-up. The types of events associated with GTB are varied and may include the occurrence of objective disease response, onset of toxicity, or seroconversion. However, comparative analyses using these types of events as predictors are different from analyses using baseline characteristics that are specified completely before the occurrence of any outcome event. Recognizing the potential for GTB is not always straightforward, and it can be challenging to know when GTB is influencing the results of an analysis. This article defines GTB, provides examples of GTB from several published articles, and discusses three analytic techniques that can be used to remove the bias: conditional landmark analysis, extended Cox model, and inverse probability weighting. The strengths and limitations of each technique are presented. As an example, we explore the effect of bisphosphonate use on disease-free survival (DFS) using data from the BIG (Breast International Group) 1-98 randomized clinical trial. An analysis using a naive approach showed substantial benefit for patients who received bisphosphonate therapy. In contrast, analyses using the three methods known to remove GTB showed no statistical evidence of a reduction in risk of a DFS event with bisphosphonate therapy.},

Disease burden due to HZ was assessed as high or rather high in 70\% of the patients. By immune fluorescence and Serion Elisa VZV IgG assessment, 90.8\% of all patients had specific anti-VZV antibodies at ASCT. Lower specific antibody titers at transplantation were observed in patients with HZ after ASCT than in those without reactivation (P=0.009). Finally, OS was better in myeloma patients with HZ after ASCT compared with patients without HZ (P=0.007). Our data indicate that VZV reactivation after ASCT is a frequent event carrying a significant disease burden and it is associated with improved survival.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To quantify the natural decline in fecundability by age and assess the effect of selected volitional factors. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of women attempting conception. SETTING: Not applicable. PARTICIPANT(S): A total of 2,820 women without infertility, trying to conceive for less than 3 cycles at study entry. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Fecundability. RESULT(S): Age had little effect on fecundability except for women 35-40 years, for whom it was 0.77 relative to women aged 20-24 years. Male age showed a similar but smaller decrease, declining to 0.95 for men aged 35-39 years. The effect of age differed for parous and nulliparous women, with the latter experiencing much stronger age-related declines relative to fecundability at age 20 years. Frequency of intercourse, use of nonhormonal birth control as the last method, and timing of intercourse, each had small effects on fecundability. Women who were in the high-fecundability categories for all three of these volitional factors had an estimated probability of conceiving of 88\% (95\% confidence interval 83\%-93\%). Unlike age, these factors represent individual choices that together can offset some of the age-related decline in fecundability. CONCLUSION(S): Fecundability peaks around age 30 years, slightly earlier for nulliparous than for parous women, and then declines. The decline with age is more modest for men. Couples will experience a compounded effect of their separate age-related declines. At age 40 years, a couple's fecundability would be approximately half of what it was at age 30 years, but some of this decline can be counteracted by volitional factors affecting conception.},

METHODS: A two-phase case-finding procedure was implemented in a cohort of 4057 cognitively intact individuals 55+ years of age living in Zaragoza, Spain, and followed-up at 2.5 and 4.5 years. Age- and sex-specific incidence rates were calculated. A mortality-adjusted, multivariate model was used to document LTRs. RESULTS: The incidence rate of dementia continued to rise after the age of 90 years, but was slightly lower than in North and West European studies. Only a tendency for an increased LTR with age was observed. Thus, LTR was 19.7\% for a 65-year-old woman and 20.4\% at the age of 85 years, the corresponding figures for AD being 16.7\% and 17.6\%. The LTR of AD was higher in women and was about twice as high among illiterate individuals when compared with individuals with higher educational levels. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rate of dementia in this Southern European city was slightly lower than in previous studies in North-West Europe. LTR of dementia and AD seems to be slightly increased with age. The association of illiteracy with higher LTR of AD is intriguing.},

	abstract = {The main neurological causes of morbidity and mortality are stroke and dementia. We contend that the most relevant and readily communicated risk estimate for stroke and dementia is lifetime risk, which is the probability of someone of a given age and sex developing a condition during their remaining lifespan. Lifetime risk estimates describe the population burden; however, they can be refined with risk-stratified models to enable individual risk prediction. Community-based data on a group of North Americans of European descent indicate that the lifetime risk of stroke for a middle-aged woman is 1 in 5 and for a middle-aged man is 1 in 6. The lifetime risk of stroke was equal to the lifetime risk of dementia and equal to or greater than the lifetime risk of Alzheimer's disease (1 in 5 and 1 in 10 for women and men, respectively), and the lifetime risk of stroke or dementia was greater than 1 in 3. Thus, the lifetime burden attributable to common neurological disease is immense.},

	abstract = {We estimated the remaining lifetime risks of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia from all causes, based on data from longitudinal population studies. The risk of developing AD during one's lifetime depends on both disease incidence and life expectancy. Conventional estimates of cumulative incidence overestimate the risk when there is a substantial probability of mortality due to competing causes. A total of 2,611 cognitively intact subjects (1,061 men, 1,550 women; mean age, 66 +/- 7 years) were prospectively evaluated for the development of AD or other dementia. A modified survival analysis was used to estimate both cumulative incidence and the sex-specific remaining lifetime risk estimates for quinquennial age groups above age 65 years. Over a 20-year follow-up period, 198 subjects developed dementia (120 with AD). The remaining lifetime risk of AD or other dementia depended on sex, being higher in women, but varied little with age between 65 and 80 years. In a 65-year-old man, the remaining lifetime risk of AD was 6.3\% (95\% CI, 3.9 to 8.7) and the remaining lifetime risk of developing any dementing illness was 10.9\% (95\% CI, 8.0 to 13.8); corresponding risks for a 65-year-old woman were 12\% (95\% CI, 9.2 to 14.8) and 19\% (95\% CI, 17.2 to 22.5). The cumulative incidence between age 65 and 100 years was much higher: for AD, 25.5\% in men and 28.1\% in women; for dementia, 32.8\% in men and 45\% in women. The actual remaining lifetime risk of AD or dementia varies with age, sex, and life expectancy and is lower than the hypothetical risk estimated by a cumulative incidence in the same population.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Some 5\%-15\% of all women experience postpartum depression (PPD), which for many is their first psychiatric disorder. The purpose of this study was to estimate the incidence of postpartum affective disorder (AD), duration of treatment, and rate of subsequent postpartum AD and other affective episodes in a nationwide cohort of women with no prior psychiatric history. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Linking information from several Danish national registers, we constructed a cohort of 457,317 primiparous mothers with first birth (and subsequent births) from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2013 (a total of 789,068 births) and no prior psychiatric hospital contacts and/or use of antidepressants. These women were followed from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2014. Postpartum AD was defined as use of antidepressants and/or hospital contact for PPD within 6 months after childbirth. The main outcome measures were risk of postpartum AD, duration of treatment, and recurrence risk. We observed 4,550 (0.6\%) postpartum episodes of AD. The analyses of treatment duration showed that 1 year after the initiation of treatment for their first episode, 27.9\% of women were still in treatment; after 4 years, 5.4\%. The recurrence risk of postpartum AD for women with a PPD hospital contact after first birth was 55.4 per 100 person-years; for women with postpartum antidepressant medication after first birth, it was 35.0 per 100 person-years. The rate of postpartum AD after second birth for women with no history of postpartum AD was 1.2 per 100 person-years. After adjusting for year of birth and mother's age, women with PPD hospital contact after first birth had a 46.4 times higher rate (95\% CI 31.5-68.4) and women with postpartum antidepressant medication after their first birth had a 26.9 times higher rate (95\% CI 21.9-33.2) of a recurrent postpartum episode after their second birth compared to women with no postpartum AD history. Limitations include the use of registry data to identify cases and limited confounder control. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, an episode of postpartum AD was observed for 0.6\% of childbirths among women with no prior psychiatric history. The observed episodes were characterized by a relatively short treatment duration, yet the women had a notably high rate of later AD and recurrent episodes of postpartum AD. The recurrence risk of postpartum AD was markedly higher among women with PPD hospital contact after first birth compared to women with postpartum antidepressant medication after first birth. Our results underline the necessity of measures targeted at specific vulnerable groups, such as women who experience PPD as a first psychiatric episode.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of postnatal depression in Nuuk, Greenland. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: The primary health care system in Nuuk initiated a project aiming to screen new mothers for depression using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). EPDS has a range on a scale from 0 to 30. All mothers residing in Nuuk who had given birth in 2011 were included in the study group. The screening was performed by health care visitors approximately 3 months following birth. Mothers who scored 13 points or above were defined as having possible postpartum depression (PPD). These mothers were then referred to a physician. A score at or less than 8 was defined as normal, whereas an intermediate score from 9 to 12 indicated a need for an extra visit. RESULTS: During 2011, a total of 217 mothers gave birth in Nuuk. Of them, 80.2\% (174) were screened for PPD using EPDS. Fifteen mothers scored 13 points or above corresponding to a prevalence of possible PPD at 8.6\% (15/174). Seventy-nine percentage scored less than 9 points (137/174), whereas 15\% (22/174) scored from 9 to 12 points. CONCLUSION: PPD seems to be a common problem in Nuuk, Greenland. EPDS seems to be a valuable tool in identifying women with PPD and vulnerable mothers with extra needs for support in a Greenlandic context. Continual routine screening is recommended.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify and test the predictive power of demographic, obstetric, and psychosocial risk factors of postpartum depression. DESIGN: Community-based, prospective follow up study based on questionnaires on past history of psychiatric disease, psychological distress and social support during pregnancy and depression at four months after delivery. Obstetric files were collected at time of birth. SETTING: Antenatal care clinic and delivery ward, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. POPULATION: 6,790 women giving birth between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 1995, who attended the antenatal clinic during pregnancy; 5,252 (78\%) completed all questionnaires. The validation population comprised 528 women enrolled immediately prior to and after the study period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Postpartum depression four months after giving birth assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. RESULTS: 5.5\% of the women suffered from postpartum depression, corresponding to a score of 13 or higher on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Risk factors identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis included psychological distress in late pregnancy (OR 6.3 [95\% CI 4.4-9.1]), perceived social isolation during pregnancy (OR 3.6 [95\% CI 1.9-7.0]); high parity (OR 3.8 [95\% CI 1.8-8.0]); and a positive history of prepregnant psychiatric disease (OR 2.1 [95\% CI 1.4-3.2]). No association was found between pregnancy or delivery complications, and postpartum depression. The maximum predictive power of the identified risk factors was 0.3. According to these results, one out of three women who suffers from psychological distress in late pregnancy with perceived social isolation will develop postpartum depression. CONCLUSION: Antenatal focus on psychosocial wellbeing may help to identify women at risk of postpartum depression.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD) is currently considered to be 10-15\%. Most studies were performed with a brief unidimensional instruments (mostly the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale-EPDS) with focus on depression and not on other symptoms and disorders. Most cited studies were conducted in Western economically developed countries. METHODS: We reviewed the literature on prevalence of postpartum depression and depressive symptoms in a wide range of countries. RESULTS: 143 studies were identified reporting prevalence in 40 countries. It is demonstrated that there is a wide range of reported prevalence of PPD ranging from almost 0\% to almost 60\%. In some countries like Singapore, Malta, Malaysia, Austria and Denmark there are very few reports of PPD or postpartum depressive symptoms, whereas in other countries (e.g. Brazil, Guyana, Costa Rica, Italy, Chile, South Africa, Taiwan and Korea) reported postpartum depressive symptoms are very prevalent. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the widely cited mean prevalence of PPD-10-15\% is not representative of the actual global prevalence and magnitude of the problem, due to the wide range of reports. The variability in reported PPD might be due to cross-cultural variables, reporting style, differences in perception of mental health and its stigma, differences in socio-economic environments (e.g. poverty, levels of social support or its perception, nutrition, stress), and biological vulnerability factors. The elucidation of the underlying processes of this variability as well as the diversity of postpartum normal versus abnormal expressions of symptoms may contribute to better understanding of the diversified ante, peri- and postpartum phenomena.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is the leading cause of disease-related disability among women in the world today. Depression is much more common among women than men, with female/male risk ratios roughly 2:1. AIMS: Recent epidemiological research is reviewed. Implications are suggested for needed future research. RESULTS: The higher prevalence of depression among women than men is due to higher risk of first onset, not to differential persistence or recurrence. Although the gender difference first emerges in puberty, other experiences related to changes in sex hormones (pregnancy, menopause, use of oral contraceptives, and use of hormone replacement therapy) do not significantly influence major depression. These observations suggest that the key to understanding the higher rates of depression among women than men lies in an investigation of the joint effects of biological vulnerabilities and environmental provoking experiences. CONCLUSIONS: Advancing understanding of female depression will require future epidemiologic research to focus on first onsets and to follow incident cohorts of young people through the pubertal transition into young adulthood with fine-grained measures of both sex hormones and gender-related environmental experiences. Experimental interventions aimed at primary prevention by jointly manipulating putative biological and environmental risk factors will likely be needed to adjudicate between contending causal hypotheses regarding the separate and joint effects of interrelated risk factors.},

Presently, the reasons for this discrepancy remain poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to determine the possible causes of the varied worldwide estimates of the disorder and to compute its worldwide-pooled prevalence. METHOD: The authors searched MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases from January 1978 to December 2005 and reviewed textbooks and reference lists of the studies selected. Authors of relevant articles from North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Middle East and ADHD/HD experts were contacted. Surveys were included if they reported point prevalence of ADHD/HD for subjects 18 years of age or younger from the general population or schools according to DSM or ICD criteria. RESULTS: The literature search generated 9,105 records, and 303 full-text articles were reviewed. One hundred and two studies comprising 171,756 subjects from all world regions were included. The ADHD/HD worldwide-pooled prevalence was 5.29\%. This estimate was associated with significant variability. In the multivariate metaregression model, diagnostic criteria, source of information, requirement of impairment for diagnosis, and geographic origin of the studies were significantly associated with ADHD/HD prevalence rates. Geographic location was associated with significant variability only between estimates from North America and both Africa and the Middle East. No significant differences were found between Europe and North America. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that geographic location plays a limited role in the reasons for the large variability of ADHD/HD prevalence estimates worldwide. Instead, this variability seems to be explained primarily by the methodological characteristics of studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The literature on the prevalence of mental disorders affecting children and adolescents has expanded significantly over the last three decades around the world. Despite the field having matured significantly, there has been no meta-analysis to calculate a worldwide-pooled prevalence and to empirically assess the sources of heterogeneity of estimates. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature searching in PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE for prevalence studies of mental disorders investigating probabilistic community samples of children and adolescents with standardized assessments methods that derive diagnoses according to the DSM or ICD. Meta-analytical techniques were used to estimate the prevalence rates of any mental disorder and individual diagnostic groups. A meta-regression analysis was performed to estimate the effect of population and sample characteristics, study methods, assessment procedures, and case definition in determining the heterogeneity of estimates. RESULTS: We included 41 studies conducted in 27 countries from every world region. The worldwide-pooled prevalence of mental disorders was 13.4\% (CI 95\% 11.3-15.9). The worldwide prevalence of any anxiety disorder was 6.5\% (CI 95\% 4.7-9.1), any depressive disorder was 2.6\% (CI 95\% 1.7-3.9), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder was 3.4\% (CI 95\% 2.6-4.5), and any disruptive disorder was 5.7\% (CI 95\% 4.0-8.1). Significant heterogeneity was detected for all pooled estimates. The multivariate metaregression analyses indicated that sample representativeness, sample frame, and diagnostic interview were significant moderators of prevalence estimates. Estimates did not vary as a function of geographic location of studies and year of data collection. The multivariate model explained 88.89\% of prevalence heterogeneity, but residual heterogeneity was still significant. Additional meta-analysis detected significant pooled difference in prevalence rates according to requirement of funcional impairment for the diagnosis of mental disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that mental disorders affect a significant number of children and adolescents worldwide. The pooled prevalence estimates and the identification of sources of heterogeneity have important implications to service, training, and research planning around the world.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parity and long term use of oral contraceptives have been associated consistently with a decreased risk of ovarian cancer. However, previous reports of the relationship of other reproductive factors (time since first use or last use of oral contraceptives, age at menarche or menopause, age at first birth) with ovarian cancer have been inconsistent. METHODS: The authors studied these relationships in the Nurses' Health Study, a prospective cohort study of 121,700 female registered nurses aged 30-55 years in 1976 when the study began. From 1976 to 1988, 260 cases of confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer occurred among 1.2 million person-years of follow-up. RESULTS: A statistically significant inverse association was observed between parity and ovarian cancer risk (relative risk [RR] = 0.84; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.77-0.91 per pregnancy); age at first birth was not associated independently with risk. In age-adjusted analyses, a significant inverse association was noted between long term use of oral contraceptives and ovarian cancer, which was no longer significant after controlling for other ovarian cancer risk factors (RR with {\textgreater} or = 5 years' use: 0.65; 95\% CI = 0.40-1.05). After control for duration of use, a weak nonsignificant inverse association was observed with time since first oral contraceptive use and no independent effect of time since last use. Neither age at menarche nor age at menopause was associated significantly with ovarian cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective study, parity was the only reproductive factor that had a substantial independent association with ovarian cancer. Long term oral contraceptive use also appeared to have an inverse relationship with ovarian cancer, although this association was of borderline significance (P = 0.11) after adjustment for other risk factors.},

	abstract = {Cancer patients may be at decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease. This hypothesis is best developed for non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), but supportive epidemiological data are sparse. We therefore conducted a nationwide cohort study of the association between NMSC and Alzheimer's disease (main outcome) and all-cause dementia. Using Danish medical databases, we identified adults diagnosed with NMSC between 1 January 1980 and 30 November 2013 (n = 216,221) and a comparison cohort of five individuals matched to each NMSC patient by sex and birth year (n = 1,081,097). We followed individuals from the time of diagnosis, or corresponding date for matched comparators, until a dementia diagnosis, death, emigration, or 30 November 2013, whichever came first. We used stratified Cox regression adjusted for comorbidities to compute hazard ratios (HRs) associating NMSC with dementia. We computed cumulative risks of dementia, treating death as a competing risk. NMSC was associated with a HR of 0.95 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92-0.98) for Alzheimer's disease and 0.92 (95\% CI: 0.90-0.94) for all-cause dementia. HRs were similar for basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma, the two most common forms of NMSC. Estimates of risk reduction were more pronounced in the beginning of follow-up, reaching null after 5-10 years. At the end of follow-up (34 years), cumulative risk of Alzheimer's disease was 4.6\% (95\% CI: 4.4\%-4.8\%) among patients with NMSC vs. 4.7\% (95\% CI: 4.6\%-4.9\%) in the comparison cohort. In conclusion, NMSC was associated with 2\%-10\% reductions in relative risks of Alzheimer's disease and all-cause dementia. However, these small inverse associations may have been caused by ascertainment bias due to decreased awareness of NMSC tumors in persons with undiagnosed early cognitive impairment or by confounding from a more neuroprotective lifestyle among persons with NMSC.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Concerns have been raised about the risk of dementia associated with antiestrogen adjuvant therapy in breast cancer, but study results have been inconsistent. We examined whether tamoxifen or other endocrine therapy was associated with dementia risk in a large population of patients with breast cancer. METHODS: We used Danish nationwide medical registries to identify patients with breast cancer diagnosed between 1990 and 2004, use of endocrine therapy, and subsequent diagnoses of dementia. We used Cox regression to estimate the risk of dementia among patients who received five years of tamoxifen or other endocrine therapies. RESULTS: The study included 16,419 patients with breast cancer. In this cohort, 37\% were unexposed to endocrine therapy, 9\% had five years of tamoxifen therapy, and 54\% had other endocrine regimens, some of them containing tamoxifen for less than five years with subsequent aromatase inhibitor therapy. Tamoxifen therapy was associated with a near-null risk of dementia [HR, 1.4; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.0-1.9], and a null association was observed after death was taken into account as a competing risk (sub-HR, 1.0; 95\% CI, 0.76-1.4). CONCLUSIONS: No clinically relevant association between use of tamoxifen or other endocrine therapy and risk of dementia was observed. IMPACT: Our result contradicts earlier research findings suggesting tamoxifen and other endocrine therapies increase the risk of dementia in breast cancer patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of depression is 4- to 5-fold higher in heart failure patients than in the general population. We examined the influence of depression on all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Danish medical registries, this nationwide population-based cohort study included all patients with a first-time hospitalization for heart failure (1995-2014). All-cause mortality risks and 19-year mortality rate ratios were estimated based on Cox regression analysis, adjusting for age, sex, time period, comorbidity, and socioeconomic status. The analysis included 9636 patients with and 194 887 patients without a diagnosis of depression. Compared with patients without a history of depression, those with depression had higher 1-year (36\% versus 33\%) and 5-year (68\% versus 63\%) mortality risks. Overall, the adjusted mortality rate ratio was 1.03 (95\% CI 1.01-1.06). Compared with no depression, the adjusted mortality rate ratios for mild, moderate, and severe depression, as defined by diagnostic codes, were 1.06 (95\% CI 1.00-1.13), 1.03 (95\% CI 0.99-1.08), and 1.02 (95\% CI 0.96-1.09), respectively. In a subcohort of patients, the mortality rate ratios were modified by left ventricular ejection fraction, with adjusted mortality rate ratios of 1.17 (95\% CI, 1.05-1.31) for {\textless}/=35\%, 0.98 (95\% CI 0.81-1.18) for 36\% to 49\%, and 0.96 (95\% CI 0.74-1.25) for {\textgreater}/=50\%. Results were consistent after adjustment for alcohol abuse and smoking. CONCLUSIONS: A history of depression was an adverse prognostic factor for all-cause mortality in heart failure patients with left ventricular ejection fraction {\textless}/=35\% but not for other heart failure patients.},

SETTING: Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: All Danish singletons born alive from 1996 to 2009 were included. Using national medical registries, we defined in utero exposure to antidepressants as redemption of an antidepressant prescription by the mother 30 days prior to or during pregnancy. We defined maternal former users of antidepressants as women, who had redeemed a prescription up to 30 days prior to pregnancy, and never users as women who had never redeemed a prescription. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ADHD was defined as redemption of a prescription for ADHD medication or an ADHD hospital diagnosis. Children were followed through 2010, and we used proportional-hazards regression to compute adjusted HRs comparing children exposed in utero and children born to former antidepressant users with children born to never users. To adjust for confounding from family-related factors, we conducted a within-mother between-pregnancy analysis comparing exposed children with unexposed siblings using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: We identified a cohort of 877 778 children, of whom 1.7\% were exposed in utero. The overall median follow-up time was 8 years; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were the most commonly used class of antidepressant during pregnancy (78\% of users). The adjusted HR comparing children exposed to any antidepressant in utero with children born to never users was 1.2 (95\% CI 1.1 to 1.4), and 1.6 (95\% CI 1.5 to 1.8) comparing children born to former users to children born to never users of antidepressants. In the within-mother between-pregnancy analysis (n=867), the adjusted OR was 0.7 (95\% CI 0.4 to 1.4). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides no evidence to support a causal association between in utero exposure to antidepressants and risk of ADHD.},

Using pharmacological, biochemical and behavioral techniques, we demonstrate that the effects of estrogen on hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory are mediated through ERbeta. Selective ERbeta agonists increased key synaptic proteins in vivo, including PSD-95, synaptophysin and the AMPA-receptor subunit GluR1. These effects were absent in ERbeta knockout mice. In hippocampal slices, ERbeta activation enhanced long-term potentiation, an effect that was absent in slices from ERbeta knockout mice. ERbeta activation induced morphological changes in hippocampal neurons in vivo, including increased dendritic branching and increased density of mushroom-type spines. An ERbeta agonist, but not an ERalpha agonist, also improved performance in hippocampus-dependent memory tasks. Our data suggest that activation of ERbeta can regulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity and improve hippocampus-dependent cognition.},

The incidence of the disease is higher in women than in men, and this cannot simply be attributed to the higher longevity of women versus men. Thus, there must be a specific pathogenic mechanism to explain the higher incidence of AD cases in women. In this regard, it is notable that mitochondria from young females are protected against amyloid-beta toxicity, generate less reactive oxygen species, and release less apoptogenic signals than those from males. However, all this advantage is lost in mitochondria from old females. Since estrogenic compounds protect against mitochondrial toxicity of amyloid-beta, estrogenic action may be important in protecting cells from amyloid-beta toxicity and suggests a possible treatment or prevention strategy for AD. Unfortunately, to date, clinical trials with Ginkgo biloba and other estrogenic therapies have not proved successful in treating AD. As such, more experiments and clinical trials are indeed warranted to find conditions in which estrogenic compounds may be useful to prevent or treat AD.},

DATA SOURCES: Forty research teams contributed data on APOE genotype, sex, age at disease onset, and ethnic background for 5930 patients who met criteria for probable or definite AD and 8607 controls without dementia who were recruited from clinical, community, and brain bank sources. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for AD, adjusted for age and study and stratified by major ethnic group (Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, and Japanese) and source, were computed for APOE genotypes epsilon2/epsilon2, epsilon2/epsilon3, epsilon2/epsilon4, epsilon3/epsilon4, and epsilon4/epsilon4 relative to the epsilon3/epsilon3 group. The influence of age and sex on the OR for each genotype was assessed using logistic regression procedures. RESULTS: Among Caucasian subjects from clinic- or autopsy-based studies, the risk of AD was significantly increased for people with genotypes epsilon2/epsilon4 (OR=2.6, 95\% CI=1.6-4.0), epsilon3/epsilon4 (OR=3.2, 95\% CI=2.8-3.8), and epsilon4/epsilon4 (OR=14.9, 95\% CI= 10.8-20.6); whereas, the ORs were decreased for people with genotypes epsilon2/epsilon2 (OR=0.6, 95\% CI=0.2-2.0) and epsilon2/epsilon3 (OR=0.6, 95\% CI=0.5-0.8). The APOE epsilon4-AD association was weaker among African Americans and Hispanics, but there was significant heterogeneity in ORs among studies of African Americans (P{\textless}.03). The APOE epsilon4-AD association in Japanese subjects was stronger than in Caucasian subjects (epsilon3/epsilon4: OR=5.6, 95\% CI=3.9-8.0; epsilon4/epsilon4: OR=33.1, 95\% CI=13.6-80.5). The epsilon2/epsilon3 genotype appears equally protective across ethnic groups. We also found that among Caucasians, APOE genotype distributions are similar in groups of patients with AD whose diagnoses were determined clinically or by autopsy. In addition, we found that the APOE epsilon4 effect is evident at all ages between 40 and 90 years but diminishes after age 70 years and that the risk of AD associated with a given genotype varies with sex. CONCLUSIONS: The APOE epsilon4 allele represents a major risk factor for AD in all ethnic groups studied, across all ages between 40 and 90 years, and in both men and women. The association between APOE epsilon4 and AD in African Americans requires clarification, and the attenuated effect of APOE epsilon4 in Hispanics should be investigated further.},

The use of corticosteroids among pregnant women ranged from 0.2\% to 10\% and increased nearly two times in recent years. Taken together, the evidence suggests that the use of corticosteroids in early pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations overall or oral clefts in offspring; at the same time, published estimates are inconsistent.

Denmark's primary health care sector, which includes general practitioners, specialists, and dentists, generates about 96\% of the prescription sales, most of which are reimbursable and are dispensed by the community pharmacies. The Aarhus University Prescription Database combines the region's pharmacy records in a single database, maintained and updated for research purposes. Each dispensation record contains patient-, drug-, and prescriber-related data. Dispensation records retain patients' universal personal identifier, which allows for individual-level linkage to all Danish registries and medical databases.

	abstract = {The Danish health care system provides partial reimbursement of most prescription medications in Denmark. The dispensation of prescription medications is registered in administrative databases. Each time a prescription is redeemed at a pharmacy, an electronic record is generated with information related to the user, prescriber, the pharmacy, and the dispensed drug. The National Health Service gathers this information for administration of the drug reimbursement plan. Recently, this information became the basis for the establishment of a new research database, the Danish National Database of Reimbursed Prescriptions (DNDRP). In this paper, we review the content, coverage, quality, linkage, access, and research possibilities of this new database. The database encompasses the reimbursement records of all reimbursed drugs sold in community pharmacies and hospital-based outpatient pharmacies in Denmark since 2004. On average, approximately 3.5 million users are recorded in the database each year. During the coverage period, the number of annual prescription redemptions increased by 15\%. Most dispensed prescriptions are in the categories "alimentary tract and metabolism", "cardiovascular system", "nervous system", and "respiratory system". Individuals are identified by the unique central personal registration (CPR) number assigned to all persons born in or immigrating to Denmark. The new database fully complies with Denmark's Act on Processing of Personal Data, while avoiding additional restrictions imposed on data use at the Danish National Prescription Registry, administered by Statistics Denmark. Most importantly, CPR numbers are reversibly encrypted, which allows re-identification of drug users; furthermore, the data access is possible outside the servers of Statistics Denmark. These features open additional opportunities for international collaboration, validation studies, studies on adverse drug effects requiring review of medical records, studies involving contact to general practitioners, and linkage of prescription data to other clinical and research databases. The DNDRP thus is a valuable data source for pharmacoepidemiological research.},

	abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Does prior depression in women treated with assisted reproduction technology (ART) influence the number of treatment cycles and ART live births? SUMMARY ANSWER: Women with a depression diagnosis prior to ART treatment initiated statistically significantly fewer ART treatment cycles and had a lower mean number of ART live births compared with women with no history of depression. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Previous studies have shown an increased prevalence of depressive symptoms in fertility patients than in the comparison groups. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A register-based national cohort study, including all women (n = 42,915) treated with IVF, ICSI, frozen embryo transfer and oocyte recipient cycle in Denmark from 1 January 1994 to 30 September 2009 extracted from the IVF register (ART cohort). Data on births and depression diagnoses were obtained by linking to the Danish Medical Birth Register (1994-2010) and the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register (1969-2010). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: For each woman in the ART cohort, we included five age-matched women from the female background population not having received ART treatment. This comparison group was cross-linked with identical register data as the ART cohort. Women with incomplete ART information or a depression diagnosis before 18 years of age were excluded; remaining n = 42,880. The ART cohort was grouped into (i) women with a depression diagnosis and (ii) women never diagnosed with depression. In the ART group with depression, analyses were specified on women with their first depression prior to ART treatment. In total, 2.6\% of the women in the ART cohort had a depression diagnosis. For the incidence rate ratio (IRR) 39,194 women from the ART cohort (3686 women were excluded due to migration) were compared with 206,005 women from the age-matched comparison group who did not receive ART treatment. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Of the women in the ART cohort with a depression diagnosis, 34.7\% had their first depression diagnosis prior to ART treatment, 4.7\% during ART treatment and 60.7\% after ART treatment. The mean number of initiated ART cycles was significantly lower in the ART group of women having a depression diagnosis prior to ART treatment [2.55 (+/-1.78)] compared with the ART group of women without a depression diagnosis [3.22 (+/-2.31); P {\textless} 0.001; P {\textless} 0.001]. Women having a depression diagnosis prior to ART treatment had a lower mean number of ART live births [0.82 (+/-0.73)] compared with women without a depression diagnosis [1.03 (+/-0.81); P {\textless} 0.001]. The incidence rate of first and recurrent depression diagnoses in the ART cohort was significantly lower compared with the age-matched background population group; IRR = 0.80 (P {\textless} 0.001) and IRR = 0.77 (P {\textless} 0.001). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Only clinical depression diagnoses treated in a psychiatric hospital setting are included. The age-matched comparison group from the background population is heterogeneous as it consists of women differing in fertility status (both mothers and childless women). WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Fewer women in the ART cohort developed depression over time compared with the age-matched background population, which might reflect a healthy patient effect of the women seeking ART treatment. Women with a depression diagnosis before ART treatment receive fewer ART treatments and are less likely to achieve an ART live birth. These women might be more vulnerable and we recommend that they be offered more psychiatric attention before starting, as well as during and after ART treatment.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This observational multimodality brain imaging study investigates emergence of endophenotypes of late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) risk during endocrine transition states in a cohort of clinically and cognitively normal women and age-matched men. METHODS: Forty-two 40- to 60-year-old cognitively normal women (15 asymptomatic perimenopausal by age [CNT], 13 perimenopausal [PERI], and 14 postmenopausal [MENO]) and 18 age- and education-matched men were examined. All patients had volumetric MRI, 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG)-PET (glucose metabolism), and Pittsburgh compound B-PET scans (beta-amyloid [Abeta] deposition, a hallmark of AD pathology). RESULTS: As expected, the MENO group was older than the PERI and CNT groups. Otherwise, groups were comparable on clinical and neuropsychological measures and APOE4 distribution. Compared to CNT women and to men, and controlling for age, PERI and MENO groups exhibited increased indicators of AD endophenotype, including hypometabolism, increased Abeta deposition, and reduced gray and white matter volumes in AD-vulnerable regions (p {\textless} 0.001). AD biomarker abnormalities were greatest in MENO, intermediate in PERI, and lowest in CNT women (p {\textless} 0.001). Abeta deposition was exacerbated in APOE4-positive MENO women relative to the other groups (p {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Multimodality brain imaging indicates sex differences in development of the AD endophenotype, suggesting that the preclinical AD phase is early in the female aging process and coincides with the endocrine transition of perimenopause. These data indicate that the optimal window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention in women is early in the endocrine aging process.},

	abstract = {After advanced age, female sex is the major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The biological mechanisms underlying the increased AD risk in women remain largely undetermined. Preclinical studies identified the perimenopause to menopause transition, a neuroendocrine transition state unique to the female, as a sex-specific risk factor for AD. In animals, estrogenic regulation of cerebral glucose metabolism (CMRglc) falters during perimenopause. This is evident in glucose hypometabolism and decline in mitochondrial efficiency which is sustained thereafter. This study bridges basic to clinical science to characterize brain bioenergetics in a cohort of forty-three, 40-60 year-old clinically and cognitively normal women at different endocrine transition stages including premenopause (controls, CNT, n = 15), perimenopause (PERI, n = 14) and postmenopause (MENO, n = 14). All participants received clinical, laboratory and neuropsychological examinations, 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG)-Positron Emission Tomography (PET) FDG-PET scans to estimate CMRglc, and platelet mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (COX) activity measures. Statistical parametric mapping and multiple regression models were used to examine clinical, CMRglc and COX data across groups. As expected, the MENO group was older than PERI and controls. Groups were otherwise comparable for clinical measures and distribution of APOE4 genotype. Both MENO and PERI groups exhibited reduced CMRglc in AD-vulnerable regions which was correlated with decline in mitochondrial COX activity compared to CNT (p's{\textless}0.001). A gradient in biomarker abnormalities was most pronounced in MENO, intermediate in PERI, and lowest in CNT (p{\textless}0.001). Biomarkers correlated with immediate and delayed memory scores (Pearson's 0.26{\textless}/=r{\textless}/=0.32, p{\textless}/=0.05).

	abstract = {Evaluating and understanding the risk and safety of using medications for autoimmune disease in a woman during her pregnancy will help both clinicians and pregnant women to make better treatment decisions. However, utilizing spontaneous abortion (SAB) data collected in observational studies of pregnancy to derive valid inference poses two major challenges. First, the data from the observational cohort are not random samples of the target population due to the sampling mechanism. Pregnant women with early SAB are more likely to be excluded from the cohort, and there may be substantial differences between the observed SAB time and those in the target population. Second, the observed data are heterogeneous and contain a "cured" proportion. In this article, we consider semiparametric models to simultaneously estimate the probability of being cured and the distribution of time to SAB for the uncured subgroup. To derive the maximum likelihood estimators, we appropriately adjust the sampling bias in the likelihood function and develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to overcome the computational challenge. We apply the empirical process theory to prove the consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimators. We examine the finite sample performance of the proposed estimators in simulation studies and illustrate the proposed method through an application to SAB data from pregnant women.},

We assessed the risk of dementia among patients with heart failure and members of a general population comparison cohort. METHODS AND RESULTS: Individual-level data from Danish medical registries were linked in this nationwide population-based cohort study comparing patients with a first-time hospitalization for heart failure between 1980 and 2012 and a year of birth-, sex-, and calendar year-matched comparison cohort from the general population. Stratified Cox regression analysis was used to compute 1-35-year hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of all-cause dementia and, secondarily, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and other dementias. Analyses included 324 418 heart failure patients and 1 622 079 individuals from the general population (median age 77 years, 52\% male). Compared with the general population cohort, risk of all-cause dementia was increased among heart failure patients [adjusted HR 1.21, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-1.24]. The associations were stronger in men and in heart failure patients under age 70. Heart failure patients had higher risks of vascular dementia (adjusted HR 1.49, 95\% CI 1.40-1.59) and other dementias (adjusted HR 1.30, 95\% CI 1.26-1.34) than members of the general population cohort. Heart failure was not associated with Alzheimer's disease (adjusted HR 1.00, 95\% CI 0.96-1.04). CONCLUSION: Heart failure was associated with an increased risk of all-cause dementia. Heart failure may represent a risk factor for dementia, but not necessarily for Alzheimer's disease.},

	abstract = {The mainstays of treatment for peripartum depression are psychotherapy and antidepressant medications. More research is needed to understand which treatments are safe, preferable, and effective. Postpartum depression, now termed peripartum depression by the DSM-V, is one of the most common complications in the postpartum period and has potentially significant negative consequences for mothers and their families. This article highlights common clinical challenges in the treatment of peripartum depression and reviews the evidence for currently available treatment options. Psychotherapy is the first-line treatment option for women with mild to moderate peripartum depression. Antidepressant medication in combination with therapy is recommended for women with moderate to severe depression. Although pooled case reports and small controlled studies have demonstrated undetectable infant serum levels and no short-term adverse events in infants of mothers breastfeeding while taking sertraline (Zoloft) and paroxetine (Paxil), further research is needed including larger samples and long-term follow-up of infants exposed to antidepressants via breastfeeding controlling for maternal depression. Pharmacologic treatment recommendations for women who are lactating must include discussion with the patient regarding the benefits of breastfeeding, risks of antidepressant use during lactation, and risks of untreated illness. There is a growing evidence base for nonpharmacologic interventions including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, which may offer an attractive option for women who wish to continue to breastfeed and are concerned about their infants being exposed to medication. Among severe cases of peripartum depression with psychosis, referral to a psychiatrist or psychiatric advanced practice registered nurse is warranted. Suicidal or homicidal ideation with a desire, intent, or plan to harm oneself or anyone else, including the infant, is a psychiatric emergency, and an evaluation by a mental health professional should be conducted immediately. Peripartum depression treatment research is limited by small sample sizes and few controlled studies. Much work is still needed to better understand which treatments women prefer and are the most effective in ameliorating the symptoms and disease burden associated with peripartum depression.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Although depression and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) may independently increase the risk for dementia, no studies have examined whether the risk for dementia among people with comorbid depression and DM is higher than the sum of each exposure individually. OBJECTIVE: To examine the risk for all-cause dementia among persons with depression, DM, or both compared with persons with neither exposure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed a national population-based cohort study of 2454532 adults, including 477133 (19.4\%) with depression, 223174 (9.1\%) with DM, and 95691 (3.9\%) with both. We included all living Danish citizens 50 years or older who were free of dementia from January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2013 (followed up through December 31, 2013). Dementia was ascertained by physician diagnosis from the Danish National Patient Register or the Danish Psychiatric Central Register and/or by prescription of a cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine hydrochloride from the Danish National Prescription Registry. Depression was ascertained by psychiatrist diagnosis from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register or by prescription of an antidepressant from the Danish National Prescription Registry. Diabetes mellitus was identified using the National Diabetes Register. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We estimated the risk for all-cause dementia associated with DM, depression, or both using Cox proportional hazards regression models that adjusted for potential confounding factors (eg, demographics) and potential intermediates (eg, medical comorbidities). RESULTS: During 13834645 person-years of follow-up, 59663 participants (2.4\%) developed dementia; of these, 6466 (10.8\%) had DM, 15729 (26.4\%) had depression, and 4022 (6.7\%) had both. The adjusted hazard ratio for developing all-cause dementia was 1.83 (95\% CI, 1.80-1.87) for persons with depression, 1.20 (95\% CI, 1.17-1.23) for persons with DM, and 2.17 (95\% CI, 2.10-2.24) for those with both compared with persons who had neither exposure. The excess risk for all-cause dementia observed for individuals with comorbid depression and DM surpassed the summed risk associated with each exposure individually, especially for persons younger than 65 years (hazard ratio, 4.84 [95\% CI, 4.21-5.55]). The corresponding attributable proportion due to the interaction of comorbid depression and DM was 0.25 (95\% CI, 0.13-0.36; P {\textless} .001) for those younger than 65 years and 0.06 (95\% CI, 0.02-0.10; P = .001) for those 65 years or older. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Depression and DM were independently associated with a greater risk for dementia, and the combined association of both exposures with the risk for all-cause dementia was stronger than the additive association.},

Cohort matching can prevent confounding by the matched variables, but censoring or other missing data and further adjustment may necessitate control of matching variables. Case-control matching generally does not prevent confounding by the matched variables, and control of matching variables may be necessary even if those were not confounders initially. Matching on variables that are affected by the exposure and the outcome, or intermediates between the exposure and the outcome, will ordinarily produce irremediable bias.},

We reviewed the CRS and its use as a research tool in epidemiology. We obtained information from the Danish Law on Civil Registration and the Central Office of Civil Registration, and used existing literature to provide illustrative examples of its use. The CRS is an administrative register established on April 2, 1968. It contains individual-level information on all persons residing in Denmark (and Greenland as of May 1, 1972). By January 2014, the CRS had cumulatively registered 9.5 million individuals and more than 400 million person-years of follow-up. A unique ten-digit Civil Personal Register number assigned to all persons in the CRS allows for technically easy, cost-effective, and unambiguous individual-level record linkage of Danish registers. Daily updated information on migration and vital status allows for nationwide cohort studies with virtually complete long-term follow-up on emigration and death. The CRS facilitates sampling of general population comparison cohorts, controls in case-control studies, family cohorts, and target groups in population surveys. The data in the CRS are virtually complete, have high accuracy, and can be retrieved for research purposes while protecting the anonymity of Danish residents. In conclusion, the CRS is a key tool for epidemiological research in Denmark.},

The genetic and environmental risk factors that have been implicated appear to be associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric outcomes, not just ADHD. The evidence to date suggests that both rare and multiple common genetic variants likely contribute to ADHD and modify its phenotype.

	abstract = {Background -Increased risk of dementia after myocardial infarction (MI) may be mediated by shared risk factors (e.g., atherosclerosis) and post-MI stroke. We examined risk of dementia in 1-year survivors of MI. Methods -Using Danish medical registries, we conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study of all patients with first-time MI and a sex-, birth year-, and calendar year-matched general population comparison cohort without MI (1980-2012). Cox regression analysis was used to compute 1-35 year adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for dementia, controlled for matching factors and adjusted for comorbidities and socioeconomic status. Results -We identified 314,911 patients with MI and 1,573,193 matched comparison cohort members randomly sampled from the general population (median age 70 years, 63\% male). After 35 years of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of all-cause dementia in the MI cohort was 9\% (2.8\% for Alzheimer's disease, 1.6\% for vascular dementia, and 4.5\% for other dementias). Compared with the general population cohort, MI was not associated with all-cause dementia (aHR = 1.01, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.98-1.03). Risk of Alzheimer's disease (aHR = 0.92, 95\% CI: 0.88-0.95) and other dementias (aHR = 0.98, 95\% CI: 0.95-1.01) also approximated unity. However, MI was associated with higher risk of vascular dementia (aHR = 1.35, 95\% CI: 1.28-1.43), which was substantially strengthened for patients experiencing stroke after MI (aHR = 4.48, 95\% CI: 3.29-6.12). Conclusions -MI was associated with higher risk of vascular dementia throughout follow-up and this asssociation was stronger in patients suffering stroke. The risk of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias was not higher in MI patients.},

The purpose of this study was to explore whether major depression and/or antisocial behavior tended to occur more frequently among partners of depressed mothers (compared to partners of nondepressed mothers) and to examine how these paternal disorders related to offspring psychopathology. METHOD: Participants were drawn from the Minnesota Twin Family Study, a community-based study of twins and their parents. Depressed and nondepressed mothers, their partners (the biological fathers of the twins), and their 17-year-old offspring were included. Structured interviews were used to assess participants for the presence of major depression, conduct disorder, and adult antisocial behavior. RESULTS: Depressed mothers tended to partner with antisocial fathers. Depression in mothers and antisocial behavior in fathers were both significantly and independently associated with offspring depression and conduct disorder. No interactions of the parental diagnoses with each other or with the gender of the offspring were found. CONCLUSIONS: Many offspring of depressed mothers experience the additional risk of having an antisocial father. The implications of these findings for risk among the offspring of depressed mothers are discussed.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Prepregnancy obesity and weight changes accompanying pregnancy (gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention) may be associated with risk of maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy and in the postpartum. The few studies that have examined these relationships report conflicting findings. METHODS: We studied pregnant (n = 2112) and postpartum (n = 1686) women enrolled in Project Viva. We used self-reported prepregnancy and postpartum weight and measured prenatal weight to calculate prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), gestational weight gain (GWG), and postpartum weight retention at 6 months after birth. We assessed elevated depressive symptoms (EDS) with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ({\textgreater}/=13 on 0-30 scale) at midpregnancy and 6 months postpartum. We used logistic regression to estimate the odds of prenatal and postpartum EDS in relation to prepregnancy BMI, GWG, and postpartum weight retention. RESULTS: A total of 214 (10\%) participants experienced prenatal EDS and 151 (9\%) postpartum EDS. Neither prepregnancy BMI nor GWG was associated with prenatal EDS. Prepregnancy obesity (BMI {\textgreater}/= 30 kg per m2) was associated with higher odds of postpartum EDS (odds ratio = 1.69, 95\% confidence interval, 1.01-2.83) compared to normal prepregnancy weight in a model adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, nativity, education, marital status, household income, parity, pregnancy intention, and smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Prepregnancy obesity is associated with elevated depressive symptoms in the postpartum period. Given the current obesity epidemic in the US and the consequences of perinatal depression, additional prevention and screening efforts in this population may be warranted.},

DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Sociofile for English-language articles published from 1980 through March 2004, conducted hand searches of bibliographies, and consulted with experts. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: We included cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies from developed countries that assessed women for depression during pregnancy or the first year postpartum with a structured clinical interview. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Of the 109 articles reviewed, 28 met our inclusion criteria. For major and minor depression (major depression alone), the combined point prevalence estimates from meta-analyses ranged from 6.5\% to 12.9\% (1.0-5.6\%) at different trimesters of pregnancy and months in the first postpartum year. The combined period prevalence shows that as many as 19.2\% (7.1\%) of women have a depressive episode (major depressive episode) during the first 3 months postpartum; most of these episodes have onset following delivery. All estimates have wide 95\% confidence intervals, showing significant uncertainty in their true levels. No conclusions could be made regarding the relative incidence of depression among pregnant and postpartum women compared with women at non-childbearing times. CONCLUSION: To better delineate periods of peak prevalence and incidence for perinatal depression and identify high risk subpopulations, we need studies with larger and more representative samples.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The global pattern of male predominance in gastric cancer incidence remains unexplained. We tested the hypothesis that estrogen prevents gastric cancer in a cohort of men heavily exposed to estrogen. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cohort study of men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer recorded in the Swedish Cancer Register in 1961-2000. Because estrogen therapy was the treatment of choice for prostate cancer in Sweden between 1950 and 1980, cohort members diagnosed earlier than 1980 were considered exposed to estrogen. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) estimated relative risk. Complete follow-up was achieved through cross-linkages within the cancer register and the Swedish nationwide registers of emigration and causes of death. RESULTS: In 515,961 person-years of follow-up, we observed 304 gastric cancers as compared with 349 expected for the cohort members in the predefined "exposed" period 1961-1980, rendering a 13\% decreased risk (SIR, 0.87; 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI), 0.78-0.98). Among patients with a latency of {\textgreater} or =15 years after a prostate cancer diagnosis in 1961-1980, SIR was 0.57 (95\% CI, 0.30-0.97), suggesting a dose-response relation. Similarly, reduced risks were found for cardia cancer and noncardia gastric cancer. No decreased risk was found for the cohort members in 1981-2000, when estrogen treatment was less common (SIR, 0.99; 95\% CI, 0.89-1.11). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates a reduced risk of gastric cancer in a male cohort exposed to estrogen. These results support the hypothesis that estrogen may prevent gastric cancer, but additional studies are warranted.},

	abstract = {The maternal immune system needs to adapt to tolerate the semi-allogeneic conceptus. Since maternal allo-reactive lymphocytes are not fully depleted, other local/systemic mechanisms play a key role in altering the immune response. The Th1/Th2 cytokine balance is not essential for a pregnancy to be normal. The immune cells, CD4+CD25+Foxp3+, also known as regulatory T cells (Tregs), step in to regulate the allo-reactive Th1 cells. In this review we discuss the role of Tregs in foeto-maternal immune tolerance and in recurrent miscarriage as well as their potential use as a new target for infertility treatment. Animal and human experiments showed Treg cell number and/or function to be diminished in miscarriages. Murine miscarriage can be prevented by transferring Tregs from normal pregnant mice. Tregs at the maternal-fetal interface prevented fetal allo-rejection by creating a "tolerant" microenvironment characterised by the expression of IL-10, TGF-beta and haem oxygenase isoform 1 (HO-1) rather than by lowering Th1 cytokines. Tregs increase placental HO-1. In turn, HO-1 may lead to up-regulation of TGF-beta, IL-10 and CTLA-4. In vivo experiments showed Tregs sensitisation from paternal antigens to be essential for maternal-fetal tolerance. Tregs increase throughout pregnancy and diminish in late puerperium. Recent data also support the capacity of Tregs to block maternal effector T cells, thereby reducing the maternal-fetal pathological responses to paternal antigens. These findings also permit us to consider new strategies for improving pregnancy outcomes, i.e., anti-TNF blockers and granulocyte-colony stimulating factors as well as novel approaches to therapeutically exploiting Treg + cell memory.},

	issn = {0378-5122 (Print) 0378-5122},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Circulating insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is mainly produced by the liver under GH stimulation and is influenced by nutrition and insulin. IGF-I bioavailability is regulated by interactions with specific binding proteins (IGFBPs). The objective of this paper is to review available data on modifications of the IGF-I system in menopausal women during HRT, with particular attention on the differential effects of progestins. METHOD: All available reports on the effects of different forms of HRT have been taken into account. RESULTS: Available data suggest that different kinds of HRT have different effect on the IGF-I system, depending on route of administration, oestrogen dose, basal IGF-I values and type of progestin. Oestrogen administration (oestrogen replacement therapy (ERT)) reduces circulating IGF-I mainly through a hepatocellular effect. The decrease is sharper when oral ERT is used (first pass hepatic effect) and in women with higher basal IGF-I levels. The progestins endowed with androgenic effects--the 19-nortestosterone derivatives and, to a lesser extent, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)--tend to reverse the IGF-I decrease induced by oral oestrogens. In contrast, progestins devoid of androgen-like hepatocellular and metabolic actions (e.g. dydrogesterone) do not interfere with the IGF-I decrease induced by oral oestrogens. Data on the effect of ERT on IGFBP-3 level are not consistent. Oral ERT, via hepatocellular actions (amplified by the first pass hepatic effect) causes a two to three-fold increase in IGFBP-1 levels. Androgenic progestins oppose the IGFBP-1 increase induced by oral oestrogens. Data on the effect of ERT and different progestins on the level of free IGF-I are scant and inconsistent. CONCLUSION: Even if some aspects need clarification, available data demonstrate that different progestins have differential effects on the circulating IGF-I system.},

	doi = {10.3109/0284186X.2015.1063775},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many studies have previously revealed evidence of an association between grand multiparity (five or more deliveries) and gynaecological cancer. Oestrogen has an impact on cancer formation and the amount of circulating oestrogen is significantly higher during pregnancy. Also the lifestyle of grand multiparous women differs somewhat from the average population. Considering these factors it is plausible that also non-gynaecological cancers are associated with multiparity. The aim of our study was to determine cancer incidence among grand multiparous women, with special attention to non-gynaecological cancers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All 102 541 women alive in 1974-2011 and having had at least five deliveries were identified in the Finnish Population Register and followed up for cancer incidence through the Finnish Cancer Registry to the end of 2011. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were defined as ratios between observed and expected numbers of cases, the latter ones based on incidence in the entire Finnish female population. RESULTS: The overall incidence of non-gynaecological cancers was the same as in the reference population (SIR 0.98, 95\% confidence interval 0.90-1.06). The incidence of cancers of the gall-bladder (SIR 1.42, 1.26-1.58), biliary tract (1.19, 1.04-1.35) and kidney (1.22, 1.14-1.31) was increased. There were significantly fewer cases than expected of urinary bladder cancer (SIR 0.70, 0.61-0.78), lung cancer (0.87, 0.81-0.92), colon cancer (0.94, 0.89-0.99) and all types of skin cancers. As a consequence of the decreased incidence of gynaecological cancers (SIR 0.74, 0.71-0.77) and breast cancer (0.60, 0.58-0.61), the SIR for cancer overall was 0.84 (0.83-0.85). CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that grand multiparous women have a similar overall risk of non-gynaecological cancers as other women, despite significant differences in some specific forms of cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data on birth outcome in women diagnosed with cancer before, during, or shortly after pregnancy are very sparse. The purpose of this review was to summarize the existing epidemiologic evidence of the adverse effect of breast cancer, cutaneous malignant melanoma, and Hodgkin's disease on birth outcome. METHODS: The MEDLINE database was used to review the literature systematically. Studies that examined the following outcomes were included: preterm birth, low birth weight, low birth weight at term, stillbirths, congenital abnormalities, male proportion of newborns, and mean birth weight. Studies were grouped according to whether the woman had been diagnosed with the specific cancer before, during, or shortly after pregnancy. RESULTS: Few data exist on birth outcome in women with breast cancer, melanoma, or Hodgkin's disease. The overall results from the limited number of studies, which included a comparison group for birth outcome, were reassuring. However, for women diagnosed with breast cancer before pregnancy, the only 2 studies that included comparison groups for birth outcome had conflicting results regarding the risk of preterm birth and congenital abnormalities. Furthermore, a recent cohort study of birth outcome in women who were diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease before pregnancy indicated a slightly increased risk of congenital abnormalities among the newborns. CONCLUSION: Overall, the existing studies offer reassuring results concerning the risks of adverse birth outcome for women diagnosed with breast cancer, melanoma, or Hodgkin's disease before, during or shortly after pregnancy. A limitation of most studies was the imprecise risk estimates caused by the small number of adverse birth outcomes and the lack of results stratified by treatment. Therefore, international collaboration is necessary in the future, to obtain more precise risk estimates for adverse birth outcomes, and to allow stratified analyses according to, for example, treatment.},

METHODS: Provincial delivery records identified the cohort of 218 890 singleton live births in Alberta, Canada,between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2004. These were followed-up for ASD via ICD-9 diagnostic codes assigned by physician billing until March 31, 2008. Maternal and obstetric risk factors were also extracted from PDR. RESULTS: Prevalence and incidence of ASD in Alberta are in line with those reported elsewhere and suggest recent increases in rate of diagnosis and/or incidence. Boys have 5-fold higher prevalence than girls. The peak age of diagnosis occurs at age 3 years. Relative risk modelling indicates that the risk of ASD is elevated among children of older mothers and those who experience specific pregnancy and birth complications. CONCLUSION: Certain maternal characteristics and obstetric complications are associated with ASD in children. We identified lower rates of ASD and later age at diagnosis among children of Aboriginal mothers that requires further research.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is uncertainty about the direction and magnitude of the associations between parity, breastfeeding and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). We examined the separate and combined associations of parity and breastfeeding practices with the incidence of CHD later in life among women in a large, pan-European cohort study. METHODS: Data were used from European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-CVD, a case-cohort study nested within the EPIC prospective study of 520,000 participants from 10 countries. Information on reproductive history was available for 14,917 women, including 5138 incident cases of CHD. Using Prentice-weighted Cox regression separately for each country followed by a random-effects meta-analysis, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for CHD, after adjustment for age, study centre and several socioeconomic and biological risk factors. RESULTS: Compared with nulliparous women, the adjusted HR was 1.19 (95\% CI: 1.01-1.41) among parous women; HRs were higher among women with more children (e.g., adjusted HR: 1.95 (95\% CI: 1.19-3.20) for women with five or more children). Compared with women who did not breastfeed, the adjusted HR was 0.71 (95\% CI: 0.52-0.98) among women who breastfed. For childbearing women who never breastfed, the adjusted HR was 1.58 (95\% CI: 1.09-2.30) compared with nulliparous women, whereas for childbearing women who breastfed, the adjusted HR was 1.19 (95\% CI: 0.99-1.43). CONCLUSION: Having more children was associated with a higher risk of CHD later in life, whereas breastfeeding was associated with a lower CHD risk. Women who both had children and breastfed did have a non-significantly higher risk of CHD.},

In this article, we review animal and human studies regarding the effects of lactation on adiposity, lipid, and glucose homeostasis.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whether increasing parity or gravidity is a risk factor for coronary heart disease has been debated, but the question remains unresolved. METHODS: We tested the association between the number of pregnancies and a variety of cardiovascular end points in two groups of women who had completed childbearing. One group comprised 2357 women who were followed for 28 years through the Framingham Heart Study, and the other 2533 women followed for at least 12 years through the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey National Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS). RESULTS: The rates of coronary heart disease were higher among multigravid women than among women who had never been pregnant, in both the Framingham Heart Study and the NHEFS, but in both studies, the higher rates were statistically significant only in women with six or more pregnancies. For the women in the Framingham Study, the rate ratio adjusted for age and educational level in the group with six or more pregnancies (as compared with women who had never been pregnant) was 1.6 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.2). For the women in the NHEFS, the same adjusted rate ratio was 1.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 1.9). Adjustments for other known cardiovascular risk factors, including weight, did not markedly alter this risk. The rate of total cardiovascular disease was also significantly higher among multigravid women in the Framingham Study than in the women who had never been pregnant. CONCLUSIONS: In two prospective American studies, having six or more pregnancies was associated with a small but consistent increase in the risk of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the United States, there is a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome, as defined by The Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (ATP III). The relationship between reproductive factors and metabolic syndrome in women is unknown. METHODS: We examined the association of number of children and breastfeeding history with metabolic syndrome risk among women. We used nationally representative data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). A total of 4699 (age {\textgreater} or = 20) nonpregnant women were included in this report. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to ATP III. RESULTS: Overall, 22.6\% of women were determined to have metabolic syndrome. The rate of metabolic syndrome was significantly higher with increasing numbers of children, demonstrating a dose-response relationship (p {\textless} 0.0001). After controlling for age, race/ethnicity, income, education, and other sociodemographic, reproductive, and behavioral risk factors, the odds of metabolic syndrome increased 13\% (95\% CI, 6\%-20\%) with each additional child. In a similarly controlled analysis in parous women, the odds of metabolic syndrome decreased 22\% (95\% CI, 1\%-39\%) in women with a history of breastfeeding for {\textgreater}1 month. However, both effects were no longer significant after inclusion of body mass index (BMI) categories. CONCLUSIONS: In a national sample of women, increasing number of children was associated with higher rates of metabolic syndrome, and history of breastfeeding was associated with decreased rates of metabolic syndrome. The strength of these relationships was decreased after additional adjustment for BMI, suggesting that weight or weight changes may be an important mediator of the effects of parity and breastfeeding on the risk of metabolic syndrome.},

After adjustment for confounders, women who used NRT during pregnancy had a HR of 0.57 (95\% CI 0.28-1.16) for stillbirth compared with those who did not use NRT. Smoking during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of stillbirth (HR 1.46, 95\% CI 1.17-1.82), while women who both smoked and used NRT had a HR of 0.83 (95\% CI 0.34-2.00) compared with nonsmoking women who did not use NRT. CONCLUSION: Our study does not indicate that use of NRT during pregnancy increases the risk of stillbirth.},

	abstract = {Smoking is a well-established risk factor for fetal growth restriction and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, and nicotine may be one of the chemical compounds that drive these associations. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a smoking cessation aid, which can facilitate smoking cessation. It is, however, unknown whether NRT used during pregnancy impairs fetal growth. The aim of this study was to estimate the association between the use of NRT during pregnancy and offspring birthweight. The study population consisted of 72 761 women enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort between 1996 and 2002. Information on NRT and potential confounders was obtained from two computer-assisted telephone interviews conducted in the second and third trimesters, respectively. Multiple linear regression in a multilevel model was used to estimate the association between NRT use and birthweight adjusted for gestational age and potential confounders. The adjusted analyses showed no significant association between the duration of NRT use and birthweight (b = 0.25 g per week of NRT use [95\% CI -2.31, 2.81]) and neither was the type of NRT product (patch, gum, inhaler) associated with reduced birthweight. However, simultaneous use of more than one NRT product was associated with reduced birthweight (b = -10.73 g per week of NRT use [95\% CI -26.51, 5.05]), although the association was not statistically significant. The results of this study suggest that maternal use of NRT in pregnancy does not seriously affect birthweight, but there could be a negative effect on birthweight associated with simultaneous use of more than one type of NRT product.},

	doi = {10.3945/ajcn.116.136291},
	abstract = {Background: Refined grains, a major source of dietary carbohydrates, have been related to impaired glucose homeostasis and obesity. Emerging animal data suggest that in utero exposure to dietary refined carbohydrates may predispose offspring to an obese phenotype, indicating a potential role for nutritional programming in the early origins of obesity, but intergenerational human data are lacking.Objective: We prospectively investigated refined-grain intake during pregnancy in association with offspring growth through age 7 y among high-risk children born to women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).Design: The analysis included 918 mother-singleton child dyads from the Danish National Birth Cohort. Offspring body mass index z scores (BMIZs) were calculated by using weight and length or height measured at birth, 5 and 12 mo, and 7 y. Overweight or obesity was defined by WHO cutoffs. Linear and Poisson regressions were used, with adjustment for maternal demographic, lifestyle, and dietary factors.Results: Refined-grain intake during pregnancy was positively associated with offspring BMIZ (adjusted beta per serving increase per day: 0.09; 95\% CI: 0.02, 0.15) and risk of overweight or obesity at age 7 y [adjusted RR (aRR) comparing the highest with the lowest quartile: 1.80; 95\% CI: 1.09, 2.98; P-trend = 0.032]. The association appeared to be more pronounced among children who were breastfed {\textless}6 mo. The substitution of 1 serving refined grains/d with an equal serving of whole grains during pregnancy was related to a 10\% reduced risk of offspring overweight or obesity at 7 y of age (aRR: 0.90; 95\% CI: 0.82, 0.98). No associations were observed between refined-grain intake and infant growth.Conclusions: Higher maternal refined-grain intake during pregnancy was significantly related to a greater BMIZ and a higher risk of overweight or obesity at age 7 y among children born after pregnancies complicated by GDM. The findings highlight pregnancy as a potential window of susceptibility associated with offspring growth and obesity risk among this high-risk population. Data with longer follow-up are warranted.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the relation between the protein:carbohydrate (P/C) ratio and added sugar intake in pregnancy and gestational weight gain (GWG). DESIGN: A prebirth cohort including 103 119 pregnancies enrolled between 1996 and 2003. SETTING: All women in Denmark were eligible to participate if they spoke Danish and were planning to carry to term.The pregnant women were recruited and enrolled during their first antenatal visit (6-10 weeks of gestation). PARTICIPANTS: Participants included women with live-born singletons and complete data on dietary intake and GWG, leaving 46 262 women for the analysis. EXPOSURE: Macronutrient intake was quantified using a validated food frequency questionnaire administered in the 25th week of gestation. The P/C ratio and added sugar intake were examined in quintiles. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: GWG was based on self-reported weight in gestational weeks 12 and 30 and defined as gain in g/week. We used multivariable linear regression, including adjusting for pre-pregnancy body mass index, to calculate relative change in GWG and 95\% CI. RESULTS: Average GWG was 471(224) g/week. The adjusted weight gain was 16 g/week lower (95\% CI 9 to 22, p for trend {\textless}0.001) in the highest (Q5) versus lowest (Q1) quintile of the P/C ratio ( approximately 3\% average reduction across the entire pregnancy). Weight gain for those with {\textgreater}20\%E vs {\textless}12\%E from protein was 36 g/week lower (95\% CI 20 to 53, p for trend {\textless}0.0001; approximately 8\% average reduction). A high P/C ratio was inversely related to intake of added sugars. Added sugar consumption was strongly associated with GWG (Q5 vs Q1: 34, 95\% CI 28 to 40 g/week, p for trend {\textless}0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: A high P/C ratio was associated with reduced GWG. This association appeared to be partly driven by a decrease in intake of added sugar. These results are consistent with randomised trials in non-pregnant participants. A dietary intervention targeting an increased P/C ratio with emphasis on reducing added sugar can contribute to reducing excessive GWG.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The in-utero environment affects fetal development; it is vital to understand how maternal diet during pregnancy influences childhood body composition. While research indicates that triglycerides in hyperglycaemic women may increase birth weight, little is known about this relationship in euglycemic women. This study examines the relationship between maternal blood lipid status and infant adiposity up to 2 years of age. METHODS: Data from 331 mother-child pairs from the ROLO longitudinal birth cohort study was analysed. Maternal dietary intakes were recorded and fasting blood lipids, leptin and HOMA were measured in early and late pregnancy and cord blood. Infant anthropometric measurements and skin-fold thicknesses were recorded at birth, 6 months and 2 years. Correlation and regression analyses were used to explore associations between maternal blood lipid status and infant adiposity. RESULTS: All maternal blood lipids increased significantly during pregnancy. Maternal dietary fat intake was positively associated with total cholesterol levels in early pregnancy. Late pregnancy triglycerides were positively associated with birth weight (P = 0.03) while cord blood triglycerides were negatively associated with birth weight (P = 0.01). Cord HDL-C was negatively associated with infant weight at 6 months (P = 0.005). No other maternal blood lipids were associated with infant weight or adiposity up to 2 years of age. CONCLUSION: Maternal and fetal triglycerides were associated with birth weight and cord HDL-C with weight at 6 months. Thus, maternal lipid concentrations may exert in-utero influences on infant body composition. There may be potential to modulate infant body composition through alteration of maternal diet during pregnancy.},

	doi = {ARTN 172.e1-15 10.1016/j.ajog.2016.09.105},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High parity has been suggested to increase risk of maternal cardiovascular disease independent of body mass index measured after childbearing. Pregnancy is, however, associated with persistent weight gain and metabolic changes that, independent of parity, increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. It could therefore be questioned if high parity independently increases the risk of cardiovascular disease or if this association may be confounded, mediated, or modified by other parity-related factors.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the association between parity and risk of cardiovascular disease, and secondary outcomes in terms of myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction, with particular focus on potential mediation by anthropometric measures and effect modification by lactation.
STUDY DESIGN: We used data from 16,515 female participants (age 44.5-73.6 years) of the population-based Malmo " Diet and Cancer Study with baseline examination from 1991 through 1996. The Malmo " Diet and Cancer Study was followed up throughout 2010, with a median follow-up of 15.8 years. We used Cox proportional hazards model to examine the association between parity and cardiovascular disease.
RESULTS: Adjusted for age and other potential confounders, grand multiparous women ({\textless}= 5 children) had an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio, 1.60; 95\% confidence interval, 1.20-2.14), myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 1.68; 95\% confidence interval, 1.15-2.45), and cerebral infarction (hazard ratio, 1.74; 95\% confidence interval, 1.18-2.58) compared to women with 2 children. Additional adjustment for baseline body mass index and weight change since age 20 years attenuated the risk, but the increased risk for cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95\% confidence interval, 1.02-1.87) and myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 1.53; 95\% confidence interval, 1.04-2.26) in grand multiparous women remained significant. Models stratified by lactation time showed that risk was only raised in grand multiparous women who had a mean lactation time of {\textless}4 mo/child. In sensitivity analyses excluding women with a history of diabetes at baseline, risk estimates for grand multiparous women became nonsignificant in the full model.
CONCLUSION: Part of the increased risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction in grand multiparous women seems to be mediated by weight gain and potentially by higher likelihood of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Lactation may modify the increased risk of grand multiparity in that longer duration might offset the cardiovascular disease risk.},

METHODS: In the Danish National Birth Cohort (1997-2003) we identified 76,768 pregnancies (and their subsequent singleton births); 20,603 were exposed to tobacco smoking during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Birth outcomes were collected by linkage to the Central Population Register, the National Patients Register, and the National Birth Register. We identified congenital malformations from the Hospital Medical Birth Registry as they were recorded at birth or in the first year of follow-up. RESULTS: Smoking mothers were younger, weighed less, consumed more alcohol, and had received less education. Children exposed to prenatal tobacco smoking had no increase in congenital malformations prevalence compared with the nonexposed children in both crude and adjusted analyses. Children born to nonsmokers, but who used nicotine substitutes, had a slightly increased relative congenital malformations prevalence ratio; relative prevalence rate ratio was 1.61 (95\% confidence interval 1.01-2.58), which represents a 60\% increased risk. When the analysis was restricted to musculoskeletal malformations, the relative prevalence rate ratio was 2.63 (95\% confidence interval 1.53-4.52). CONCLUSION: Our results showed no increase in congenital malformations related to prenatal tobacco smoking. However, we identified an increase of malformations risk in nonsmokers using nicotine substitutes. This finding needs to be replicated in other data sources. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II-2.},

	abstract = {Obesity, particularly the abdominal phenotype, is associated with several reproductive disturbances. Whereas mechanisms by which obesity affect fertility are complex and still not completely understood, an important role appears to be played by the presence of a condition of functional hyperandrogenism and hyperinsulinaemia, which accompanies the insulin-resistant state. In women with the polycystic ovary syndrome, abdominal obesity may be co-responsible for the development of hyperandrogenism and associated chronic anovulation, through mechanisms primarily involving the insulin-mediated overstimulation of ovarian steroidogenesis and decreased sex hormone-binding globulin blood concentrations. By these mechanisms, obesity may also favour resistance to clomiphene and gonadotrophin-induced ovulation and reduce outcomes of IVF/ICSI procedures. Due to the beneficial effects of weight loss, lifestyle intervention programmes should represent the first-line approach in the treatment of infertile obese women. Insulin-sensitizing agents may add further benefits, particularly if administered in combination with hypocaloric dieting. Therefore, individualized pharmacological support aimed at favouring weight loss and improving insulin resistance should be widely extended in clinical practice in obese infertile patients. This may be beneficial even during pregnancy, thereby permitting favourable physiological delivery and healthy babies.},

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from the database of a tertiary recurrent miscarriage center. SETTING: The recurrent miscarriage clinic at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals. PATIENT(S): A total of 844 pregnancies from 491 patients with recurrent miscarriage were included in the analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The odds of miscarriage in the subsequent pregnancy for all pregnancies after referral to the recurrent miscarriage clinic as well as the first pregnancy post referral. RESULT(S): When analyzing all pregnancies, and compared to women with a normal body mass index, obese and underweight patients had a significantly higher odds of miscarriage in the subsequent pregnancy (OR, 1.71; 95\% CI, 1.05-2.8; and OR, 3.98; 95\% CI, 1.06-14.92; respectively), whereas there was no significantly increased odds of miscarriage in overweight women (OR, 1.02; 95\% CI, 0.72-1.45).

CONCLUSION(S): In women with recurrent miscarriage, a mild increase in the body mass index does not increase the risk of miscarriage, whereas obese and underweight patients have a small but significant increased risk of miscarriage in the subsequent pregnancy.},

The purpose of this study is to better understand the effect of obesity on early pregnancy success by examining the cytogenetic results of miscarriages in women with normal and elevated body mass index (BMI). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study in an academic infertility practice. Medical records of women ages {\textless}40 years with first trimester missed abortion (n = 204), who underwent dilatation and curettage between 1999 and 2008, were reviewed for demographics, BMI, diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and karyotype analysis. chi(2) and Student's t-test analysis were used for statistical analysis, with P {\textless} 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 204 miscarriages were included, from women with a mean age of 34.5 years. The overall rate of aneuploidy was 59\%. Women with BMI {\textgreater} or = 25 kg/m(2) had a significant increase in euploid miscarriages compared with women with lower BMI (P = 0.04), despite a similar mean age (34.4 years for both). CONCLUSIONS: We found a significant increase in normal embryonic karyotypes in the miscarriages of overweight and obese women (BMI {\textgreater} or = 25). These results suggest that the excess risk of miscarriages in the overweight and obese population is independent of embryonic aneuploidy. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of lifestyle modification, insulin resistance and PCOS on pregnancy outcomes in the overweight and obese population.},

In this review, we discuss some historical background to life course epidemiology and theoretical models of life course processes, and we review some of the empirical evidence linking life course processes to coronary heart disease, hemorrhagic stroke, type II diabetes, breast cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We also underscore that a life course approach offers a way to conceptualize how underlying socio-environmental determinants of health, experienced at different life course stages, can differentially influence the development of chronic diseases, as mediated through proximal specific biological processes.},

In contrast, the estrogen-alone trial showed no incidence reduction or differential stage at diagnosis. Here, data from the WHI observational study are considered, in conjunction with colorectal cancer mortality data from the hormone therapy trials, in an attempt to clarify postmenopausal hormone therapy effects. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal women ages 50 to 79 years at WHI enrollment. Estrogen-alone analyses include 21,552 and 10,739 women who were posthysterectomy from the observational study and clinical trial, respectively. Estrogen plus progestin analyses include 32,084 and 16,608 observational study and clinical trial women with uterus. Colorectal cancers were verified by central medical and pathology report review. RESULTS: Hazard ratios (95\% confidence intervals) from the WHI observational study were 0.80 (0.53-1.20) for estrogen and 1.15 (0.74-1.79) for estrogen plus progestin, with, respectively, 168 and 175 women diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Delayed diagnosis with estrogen plus progestin is not evident in the observational study. No protective effect on colorectal cancer mortality in the estrogen plus progestin trial is seen over an 8-year intervention and follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Hazard ratio patterns in the WHI clinical trial and observational study do not provide strong evidence of a clinically important colorectal cancer benefit with either estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin over 7 to 8 years of treatment and follow-up.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hormonal and reproductive factors contribute to the development of ovarian cancer, but few studies have examined associations between circulating estrogens and estrogen metabolites and ovarian cancer risk. We evaluated whether serum estrogens and estrogen metabolite levels are associated with ovarian cancer risk among postmenopausal women in a nested case-control study in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Observational Study (OS). METHODS: We selected all 169 eligible epithelial ovarian cancer cases and 412 matched controls from women enrolled in WHI-OS who were not using menopausal hormones at baseline. Baseline levels of 15 estrogens and estrogen metabolites were measured via liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Associations with ovarian cancer risk overall and stratified by histologic subtype (serous/nonserous) were analyzed using logistic regression. The mean time from serum collection to cancer diagnosis was 6.9 years. RESULTS: Overall, we observed modest ovarian cancer risk associations among women with higher levels of estrone [OR (95\% confidence interval) quintile (Q)5 vs. Q1: 1.54 (0.82-2.90), Ptrend = 0.05], as well as 2- and 4-methoxyestrone metabolites [2.03 (1.06-3.88), Ptrend = 0.02; 1.86 (0.98-3.56), Ptrend = 0.01, respectively]. Associations of estrogens and estrogen metabolites varied substantially by histologic subtype. Associations with serous tumors were universally null, while estrone [2.65 (1.09-6.45), Ptrend = 0.01, Pheterogeneity = 0.04], unconjugated estradiol [2.72 (1.04-7.14), Ptrend = 0.03, Pheterogeneity = 0.02] and many of the 2-, 4-, and 16-pathway metabolites were positively associated with nonserous tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides novel molecular data showing an association of the parent estrogens and several estrogen metabolites with nonserous ovarian cancers.

	abstract = {Early epidemiologic studies of estrogen metabolism measured only 2-hydroxyestrone and 16alpha-hydroxyestrone and relied on direct enzyme immunoassays without purification steps. Eight breast cancer studies have used these assays with prospectively collected blood or urine samples. Results were inconsistent, and generally not statistically significant; but the assays had limited specificity, especially at the low concentrations characteristic of postmenopausal women. To facilitate continued testing in population-based studies of the multiple laboratory-based hypotheses about the roles of estrogen metabolites, a novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay was developed to measure concurrently all 15 estrogens and estrogen metabolites in human serum and urine, as unconjugated and total (glucuronidated+sulfated+unconjugated) concentrations. The assay has high sensitivity (lower limit of quantitation approximately 1-2 pmol/L), reproducibility (coefficients of variation generally 5\%), and accuracy. Three prospective studies utilizing this comprehensive assay have demonstrated that enhanced 2-hydroxylation of parent estrogens (estrone+estradiol) is associated with reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. In the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) cohort, the serum ratio of 2-hydroxylation pathway metabolites to parent estrogens was associated with a 28\% reduction in breast cancer risk across extreme deciles (p-trend=.05), after adjusting for unconjugated estradiol and breast cancer risk factors. Incorporating this ratio into a risk prediction model already including unconjugated estradiol improved absolute risk estimates substantially (by 14\%) in 36\% of the women, an encouraging result that needs replication. Additional epidemiologic studies of the role of estrogen metabolism in the etiology of hormone-related diseases and continued improvement of estrogen metabolism assays are justified.},

DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: Singleton births registered in the Swedish medical birth register between 1995 and 2007. PARTICIPANTS: By linkage with the Swedish patient register, 3787 births among women with a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome and 1,191,336 births among women without such a diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, stillbirth, neonatal death, low Apgar score ({\textless}7 at five minutes), meconium aspiration, large for gestational age, macrosomia, small for gestational age), adjusted for maternal characteristics (body mass index, age), socioeconomic factors (educational level, and cohabitating with infant's father), and assisted reproductive technology. RESULTS: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome were more often obese and more commonly used assisted reproductive technology than women without such a diagnosis (60.6\% v 34.8\% and 13.7\% v 1.5\%). Polycystic ovary syndrome was strongly associated with pre-eclampsia (adjusted odds ratio 1.45, 95\% confidence interval 1.24 to 1.69) and very preterm birth (2.21, 1.69 to 2.90) and the risk of gestational diabetes was more than doubled (2.32, 1.88 to 2.88). Infants born to mothers with polycystic ovary syndrome were more prone to be large for gestational age (1.39, 1.19 to 1.62) and were at increased risk of meconium aspiration (2.02, 1.13 to 3.61) and having a low Apgar score ({\textless}7) at five minutes (1.41, 1.09 to 1.83). CONCLUSIONS: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes that cannot be explained by assisted reproductive technology. These women may need increased surveillance during pregnancy and parturition.},

	abstract = {A miscarriage is the most frequent complication of a pregnancy. Poor chromosome preparations, culture failure, or maternal cell contamination may hamper conventional karyotyping. Techniques such as chromosomal comparative genomic hybridization (chromosomal-CGH), array-comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) enable us to trace submicroscopic abnormalities. We found the prevalence of chromosome abnormalities in women facing a single sporadic miscarriage to be 45\% (95\% CI: 38-52; 13 studies, 7012 samples). The prevalence of chromosome abnormalities in women experiencing a subsequent miscarriage after preceding recurrent miscarriage proved to be comparable: 39\% (95\% CI: 29-50; 6 studies 1359 samples). More chromosome abnormalities are detected by conventional karyotyping compared to FISH or MLPA only (chromosome region specific techniques), and the same amount of abnormalities compared to QF-PCR (chromosome region specific techniques) and chromosomal-CGH and array-CGH (whole genome techniques) only. Molecular techniques could play a role as an additional technique when culture failure or maternal contamination occurs: recent studies show that by using array-CGH, an additional 5\% of submicroscopic chromosome variants can be detected. Because of the small sample size as well as the unknown clinical relevance of these molecular aberrations, more and larger studies should be performed of submicroscopic chromosome abnormalities among sporadic miscarriage samples. For recurrent miscarriage samples molecular technique studies are relatively new. It has often been suggested that miscarriages are due to chromosomal abnormalities in more than 50\%, but the present review has determined that chromosomal and submicroscopic genetic abnormalities on average are prevalent in maximally half of the miscarriage samples.

Data were collected with a set of self-reported questionnaires, a clinical health examination and/or a home interview. A modified Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), the Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI) and other non-structured interviews were used for the assessment of mental health. A diagnosis of depressive disorder and the presence of depressive symptoms were more prevalent among women with a history of miscarriage. In both datasets the higher the number of miscarriages was, the worse the current state of mood was and the higher the frequency of a psychiatric diagnosis was.

	abstract = {The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) is an ongoing multi-centre prospective cohort study designed to investigate the relationship between nutrition and cancer, with the potential for studying other diseases as well. The study currently includes 519 978 participants (366 521 women and 153 457 men, mostly aged 35-70 years) in 23 centres located in 10 European countries, to be followed for cancer incidence and cause-specific mortality for several decades. At enrollment, which took place between 1992 and 2000 at each of the different centres, information was collected through a non-dietary questionnaire on lifestyle variables and through a dietary questionnaire addressing usual diet. Anthropometric measurements were performed and blood samples taken, from which plasma, serum, red cells and buffy coat fractions were separated and aliquoted for long-term storage, mostly in liquid nitrogen. To calibrate dietary measurements, a standardised, computer-assisted 24-hour dietary recall was implemented at each centre on stratified random samples of the participants, for a total of 36 900 subjects. EPIC represents the largest single resource available today world-wide for prospective investigations on the aetiology of cancers (and other diseases) that can integrate questionnaire data on lifestyle and diet, biomarkers of diet and of endogenous metabolism (e.g. hormones and growth factors) and genetic polymorphisms. First results of case-control studies nested within the cohort are expected early in 2003. The present paper provides a description of the EPIC study, with the aim of simplifying reference to it in future papers reporting substantive or methodological studies carried out in the EPIC cohort.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The most consistent result of epidemiological studies on diet and cancer is that a diet rich in vegetables, fruit and, more generally, in plant foods is associated with a reduced risk of cancer at several anatomical sites. Epidemiological studies have been less consistent regarding the putative increase in risk related to consumption of fat or meat. In addition it has not been possible to identify clearly the biological role of specific nutrients or non-nutrient food components in the prevention or causation of cancer. Limitations in the precision and validity of traditional dietary intake measurements and limited use of biomarkers combined with narrow ranges of variations in dietary habits within single populations, have been the main reasons for the limited success in identifying more specific diet and cancer links. METHODS: EPIC is a multi-centre prospective cohort study designed to investigate the relation between diet, nutritional and metabolic characteristics, various lifestyle factors and the risk of cancer. The study is based in 22 collaborating centres in nine European countries and includes populations characterized by large variations in dietary habits and cancer risk. Data are collected on diet, physical activity, sexual maturation and reproductive history, lifetime consumption of alcohol and tobacco, previous and current illnesses and current medication. Following a common protocol and using identical equipment, blood samples are collected, aliquoted into plasma, serum, white blood cells and erythrocytes, and stored in liquid nitrogen at -196 degrees C for future laboratory analyses on cancer cases and matched healthy controls. Anthropometric measurements are taken according to a standard protocol. It is planned to include around 400,000 middle-aged men and women. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The collection of questionnaire data, anthropometric measurements and blood samples is under way. Almost 340,000 subjects had been included in the study by mid-1996, and recruitment is expected to be almost complete by 1997. Follow-up for cancer incidence and total mortality has started and it is expected that about 23000 cancer cases will be identified during the first 10 years of follow-up.},

This literature review assesses the published evidence concerning the association between PSP and PTB, highlighting established and hypothesized physiological pathways mediating this association. METHOD: The PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched using the keywords "psychosocial stress", "pregnancy", "pregnancy stress", "preterm", "preterm birth", "gestational age", "anxiety", and "social support". After applying the exclusion criteria, the search produced 107 articles. RESULTS: The association of PSP with PTB varied according to the dimensions and timing of PSP. Stronger associations were generally found in early pregnancy, and most studies demonstrating positive results found moderate effect sizes, with risk ratios between 1.2 and 2.1. Subjective perception of stress and pregnancy-related anxiety appeared to be the stress measures most closely associated with PTB. Potential physiological pathways identified included behavioral, infectious, neuroinflammatory, and neuroendocrine mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: Future research should examine the biological pathways of these different psychosocial stress dimensions and at multiple time points across pregnancy. Culture-independent characterization of the vaginal microbiome and noninvasive monitoring of cholinergic activity represent two exciting frontiers in this research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Published guidelines emphasise the need for early antenatal care to promote maternal and neonatal health. Inadequate engagement with antenatal care is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including maternal death. The factors that influence the uptake and utilisation of maternity care services are poorly understood. We retrospectively explore a large maternity database of births in a large referral UK hospital to capture the socio-demographic factors that influence late pregnancy booking, and then prospectively compare the stress and social support status of consenting early and late-booking women. METHODS: Retrospective socio-demographic and clinical outcome data on 59,487 women were collected from the maternity database record of births between 2002 and 2010 at the Jessop Wing Hospital, Sheffield UK. In a follow-on prospective survey between October 2012 and May 2013 a convenience cohort of early and late bookers for antenatal care were then studied using validated scales for fetomaternal attachment, stress and anxiety, and social support. RESULTS: In our retrospective study, pregnancy during the teenage years, higher parity, non-white ethnic background, unemployment and smoking were significantly associated with late access to antenatal services and poor fetal outcomes (P {\textless} 0.001). However, late booking per se did not predict adverse fetal outcomes, when socio-demographic factors were accounted for. A high index of multiple deprivation (IMD) score remained independently associated with late booking when confounding factors such as ethnicity and employment status were controlled for in the model (P = 0.03). Our prospective data demonstrated that women who book late were more likely to be unmarried (OR: 3.571, 95 \% CI: 1.464-8.196, p = .005), of high parity (OR: 1.759, 95 \% CI: 1.154-2.684, P = 0.009), and have lower social support than early bookers (P = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: Of the many complex sociocultural factors that influence the timing of maternal engagement with antenatal care, multiple deprivation and poor social support remain key factors. Improving access to prenatal care requires in-depth exploration of the relationship between maternal psychosocial health indices, social support mechanisms and engagement with antenatal care. Findings from these studies should inform interventions aimed at improving access to care.},

	abstract = {Stress begins in the brain and affects the brain, as well as the rest of the body. Acute stress responses promote adaptation and survival via responses of neural, cardiovascular, autonomic, immune and metabolic systems. Chronic stress can promote and exacerbate pathophysiology through the same systems that are dysregulated. The burden of chronic stress and accompanying changes in personal behaviors (smoking, eating too much, drinking, poor quality sleep; otherwise referred to as "lifestyle") is called allostatic overload. Brain regions such as hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and amygdala respond to acute and chronic stress and show changes in morphology and chemistry that are largely reversible if the chronic stress lasts for weeks. However, it is not clear whether prolonged stress for many months or years may have irreversible effects on the brain. The adaptive plasticity of chronic stress involves many mediators, including glucocorticoids, excitatory amino acids, endogenous factors such as brain neurotrophic factor (BDNF), polysialated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). The role of this stress-induced remodeling of neural circuitry is discussed in relation to psychiatric illnesses, as well as chronic stress and the concept of top-down regulation of cognitive, autonomic and neuroendocrine function. This concept leads to a different way of regarding more holistic manipulations, such as physical activity and social support as an important complement to pharmaceutical therapy in treatment of the common phenomenon of being "stressed out". Policies of government and the private sector play an important role in this top-down view of minimizing the burden of chronic stress and related lifestyle (i.e. allostatic overload).},

METHODS: Electronic databases (AMED, British Nursing Index, CINAHL, MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, PubMEd, ScienceDirect) were searched for articles using PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Data from 48 studies were included. Quality of the research was generally good. PTS/PTSD has been investigated in TOP and miscarriage more than perinatal loss, stillbirth, and neonatal death. In all reproductive losses and TOPs, the prevalence of PTS was greater than PTSD, both decreased over time, and longer gestational age is associated with higher levels of PTS/PTSD. Women have generally reported more PTS or PTSD than men. Sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., younger age, lower education, and history of previous traumas or mental health problems) and psychsocial factors influence PTS and PTSD after TOP and reproductive loss. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review is the first to investigate PTS/PTSD after reproductive loss. Patients with advanced pregnancies, a history of previous traumas, mental health problems, and adverse psychosocial profiles should be considered as high risk for developing PTS or PTSD following reproductive loss.},

Patients who had live births (n=20) during the study period had significantly lower scores in the Positive Affect scale (P{\textless}0.05, adjusted OR 1.17) than those who miscarried (n=10). There was a little association between psychological stress measurements and biochemical stress measurements. These results suggest that stress is a risk factor of RM.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the frequency and timing of binge drinking episodes (intake of five or more drinks on one occasion) during the first 16 weeks of pregnancy increase the risk of fetal death. METHODS: The study is based upon data from 89,201 women who were enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort from 1996 to 2002 and participated in an interview that took place in midpregnancy (n=86,752) or after a fetal loss (n=2,449). In total, 3,714 pregnancies resulted in fetal death. Data were analyzed by means of Cox regression models. RESULTS: Neither the frequency nor the timing of binge episodes was related to the risk of early (at or before 12 completed weeks) or late (13-21 completed weeks) spontaneous abortion. However, three or more binge episodes showed an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.56 (95\% confidence interval 1.01-2.40) for stillbirth (22 or more completed weeks) relative to nonbinge drinkers. Women with an average intake of three or more drinks per week and two or more binge drinking episodes had a hazard ratio of 2.20 (95\% confidence interval 1.73-2.80) compared with women with no average intake and no binge drinking. CONCLUSION: Binge drinking three or more times during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of stillbirth, but neither frequency nor timing of binge drinking was associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion in clinically recognized pregnancies.},

We examined the association of maternal average alcohol intake and binge drinking ({\textgreater}or=5 drinks per sitting) with infant mortality, both in the neonatal and postneonatal period. METHODS: Participants were 79,216 mothers who were enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort in 1996-2002, gave birth to a live-born singleton, and provided information while they were pregnant on alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Information on infant mortality and causes of death was obtained from national registries and medical records. RESULTS: During the first year of life, 279 children (0.35\%) died, 204 during the neonatal period. Infant mortality was not associated with alcohol drinking, even at a consumption level of either 4+ drinks per week or 3+ occasions of binge drinking. Postneonatal mortality was associated with an intake of 4+ drinks per week (hazard ratio = 3.56 [95\% confidence interval = 1.15-8.43]) and with 3+ binge episodes (2.69 [1.27-5.69]). When restricting analyses to term births, both infant mortality and postneonatal mortality were associated with a weekly average intake of 4+ drinks or 3+ binge episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Among term infants, intake of at least 4 drinks of alcohol per week or binging on 3 or more occasions during pregnancy are associated with an increased risk of infant mortality, especially during the postneonatal period.},

RESULTS: The overall participation rate was 31\%. Women outside the work force or with no further education than compulsory school were underrepresented in the DNBC by 62\% (59\%; 64\%) and 43\% (41\%; 45\%), respectively. Also, women were underrepresented by 18\% (13\%; 23\%) if they were unemployed, by 22\% (20\%; 24\%) if they were in the lowest income group, 38\% (35\%; 40\%) if they received a high proportion of social benefits, and 28\% (24\%; 31\%) if they were singles. Particularly women with low resources according to two socioeconomic factors were strongly underrepresented, typically by 50-67\%. CONCLUSION: Groups with low socioeconomic resources in terms of education, occupation, income and civil status are underrepresented in the DNBC compared to the background population. These discrepancies must be taken into account when results from the DNBC and other cohorts of pregnant women are interpreted-especially when descriptive results are presented.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is well known that the time from conception to early childhood has importance for health conditions that reach into later stages of life. Recent research supports this view, and diseases such as cardiovascular morbidity, cancer, mental illnesses, asthma, and allergy may all have component causes that act early in life. Exposures in this period, which influence fetal growth, cell divisions, and organ functioning, may have long-lasting impact on health and disease susceptibility. METHODS: To investigate these issues the Danish National Birth Cohort (Better health for mother and child) was established. A large cohort of pregnant women with long-term follow-up of the offspring was the obvious choice because many of the exposures of interest cannot be reconstructed with sufficient validity back in time. The study needs to be large, and it is aimed to recruit 100,000 women early in pregnancy, and to continue follow-up for decades. The Nordic countries are better suited for this kind of research than most other countries because of their population-based registers on diseases, demography and social conditions, linkable at the individual level by means of the unique ID-number given to all citizens. Exposure information is mainly collected by computer-assisted telephone interviews with the women twice during pregnancy and when their children are six and 18 months old. Participants are also asked to fill in a self-administered food frequency questionnaire in mid-pregnancy. Furthermore, a biological bank has been set up with blood taken from the mother twice during pregnancy and blood from the umbilical cord taken shortly after birth. Data collection started in 1996 and the project covered all regions in Denmark in 1999. By August 2000. a total of 60,000 pregnant women had been recruited to the study. It is expected that a large number of gene-environmental hypotheses need to be based on case-control analyses within a cohort like this.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR), the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to test causal effects, is increasingly used in aetiological epidemiology. Few of the methodological developments in MR have considered the specific situation of using genetic IVs to test the causal effect of exposures in pregnant women on postnatal offspring outcomes. In this paper, we describe specific ways in which the IV assumptions might be violated when MR is used to test such intrauterine effects. We highlight the importance of considering the extent to which there is overlap between genetic variants in offspring that influence their outcome with genetic variants used as IVs in their mothers. Where there is overlap, and particularly if it generates a strong association of maternal genetic IVs with offspring outcome via the offspring genotype, the exclusion restriction assumption of IV analyses will be violated. We recommend a set of analyses that ought to be considered when MR is used to address research questions concerned with intrauterine effects on post-natal offspring outcomes, and provide details of how these can be undertaken and interpreted. These additional analyses include the use of genetic data from offspring and fathers, examining associations using maternal non-transmitted alleles, and using simulated data in sensitivity analyses (for which we provide code). We explore the extent to which new methods that have been developed for exploring violation of the exclusion restriction assumption in the two-sample setting (MR-Egger and median based methods) might be used when exploring intrauterine effects in one-sample MR. We provide a list of recommendations that researchers should use when applying MR to test the effects of intrauterine exposures on postnatal offspring outcomes and use an illustrative example with real data to demonstrate how our recommendations can be applied and subsequent results appropriately interpreted.},

However, there are no robust estimates of anxiety, depression and stress for this group. We meta-analytically estimated rates of anxiety, depression and stress in pregnant women and their partners during pregnancies after previous perinatal loss METHODS: Databases (Medline, PsychInfo, Embase, Cinahl Plus) and grey literature were searched from 1995 through to May 2016. Search terms included: depression, anxiety, or stress with perinatal loss (miscarry*, perinatal death, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, intrauterine death, TOPFA) and subsequent pregnancy. Case-controlled, English-language studies using validated measures of anxiety, depression or stress in women or partners during pregnancy following perinatal loss were included. Data for effect sizes, study and demographic data were extracted. RESULTS: We identified nineteen studies representing n = 5114 women with previous loss; n = 30,272 controls; n = 106 partners with previous perinatal loss; and n = 91 control men. Random effects modelling demonstrated significant effects of perinatal loss on anxiety (d = 0.69, 95\% CI = 0.41-0.97) and depression (d = 0.22, 95\% CI = 0.15-0.30) in women; but no effect on stress (d = - 0.002, 95\% CI = - 0.0639 to 0.0605). LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by the quality of available studies, underpowered moderator analyses and an inability to examine additional covariates. Insufficient data were available to generate reliable effects for psychological distress in partners. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm elevated anxiety and depression levels during pregnancies following perinatal loss. Further research on predictors of distress in women and their partners is required.},

RESULTS: Our data indicated smaller babies in exercising women compared with nonexercisers, but the differences were small, and only a few were statistically significant. Exercising women had a slightly decreased risk of having a child small for gestational age (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95\% confidence interval, 0.83-0.92) and large for gestational age (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95\% confidence interval, 0.89-0.98). CONCLUSION: The findings do not indicate sizable effects on fetal growth measures related to exercise apart from a modest decreased risk of small- and large-for-gestational-age infants.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although both maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG) may affect birth weight, their separate and joint associations with complications of pregnancy and delivery and with postpartum weight retention are unclear. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the combined associations of prepregnancy BMI and GWG with pregnancy outcomes and to evaluate the trade-offs between mother and infant for different weight gains. DESIGN: Data for 60892 term pregnancies in the Danish National Birth Cohort were linked to birth and hospital discharge registers. Self-reported total GWG was categorized as low ({\textless}10 kg), medium (10-15 kg), high (16-19 kg), or very high ({\textgreater}or=20 kg). Adjusted associations of prepregnancy BMI and GWG with outcomes of interest were estimated by logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: High and very high GWG added to the associations of high prepregnancy BMI with cesarean delivery and were strongly associated with high postpartum weight retention. Moreover, greater weight gains and high maternal BMI decreased the risk of growth restriction and increased the risk of the infant's being born large-for-gestational-age or with a low Apgar score. Generally, low GWG was advantageous for the mother, but it increased the risk of having a small baby, particularly for underweight women. CONCLUSIONS: Heavier women may benefit from avoiding high and very high GWG, which brings only a slight increase in the risk of growth restriction for the infant. High weight gain in underweight women does not appear to have deleterious consequences for them or their infants, but they may want to avoid low GWG to prevent having a small baby.},

SETTING: Danish National Birth Cohort. POPULATION: A cohort of 49 178 pregnant women recruited between 1996 and 2002. METHODS: Data obtained from computer-assisted telephone interviews twice during pregnancy were used to identify children born to: (i) depressed women who took antidepressants during pregnancy (n = 210); (ii) depressed women who did not take any antidepressants during pregnancy (n = 231); and (iii) healthy women who were not depressed (n = 48 737). Childhood behavioural problems at 7 years of age were examined using the validated Danish parent-report version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: SDQ scores. RESULTS: No associations were observed between prenatal antidepressant exposure and abnormal SDQ scores for overall problem behaviour (adjusted relative risk, aRR 1.00; 95\% confidence interval, 95\% CI 0.49-2.05), hyperactivity/inattention (aRR 0.99; 95\% CI 0.56-1.75), or peer problems (aRR 1.04; 95\% CI 0.57-1.91). Although prenatal antidepressant exposure appeared to be associated with abnormal SDQ scores on the subscales of emotional symptoms (aRR 1.68; 95\% CI 1.18-2.38) and conduct problems (aRR 1.58; 95\% CI 1.03-2.42), these associations were significantly attenuated following adjustment for antenatal mood status (aRR 1.20; 95\% CI 0.85-1.70 and aRR 1.19; 95\% CI 0.77 1.83, respectively). Untreated prenatal depression was associated with an increased risk of all behavioural outcomes evaluated, compared with unexposed children, with significant attenuation following adjustment for antenatal mood status. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that independent of maternal illness, prenatal antidepressant exposure is not associated with an increased risk of behavioural problems in children at 7 years of age.

METHODS: The study population consisted of 188 788 children in the Mothers and Babies in Norway and Denmark CP study, using data from 2 population-based, prospective birth cohorts: the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study and the Danish National Birth Cohort. Prepregnancy BMI was classified as underweight (BMI {\textless}18.5), lower normal weight (BMI 18.5-22.9), upper normal weight (BMI 23.0-24.9), overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9), and obese (BMI {\textgreater}/=30). CP diagnoses were obtained from the national CP registries. Associations between maternal prepregnancy BMI and CP in offspring were investigated by using log-binomial regression models. RESULTS: The 2 cohorts had 390 eligible cases of CP (2.1 per 1000 live-born children). Compared with mothers in the lower normal weight group, mothers in the upper normal group had a 40\% excess risk of having a child with CP (relative risk [RR], 1.35; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.78). Excess risk was 60\% (RR, 1.56; 95\% CI, 1.21-2.01) for overweight mothers and 60\% (RR, 1.55; 95\% CI 1.11-2.18) for obese mothers. The risk of CP increased approximately 4\% for each unit increase in BMI (RR, 1.04; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.06). Estimates changed little with adjustment for mother's occupational status, age, and smoking habits.

The extent to which fish intake in pregnancy protects against child asthma and rhinitis symptoms remains unclear. We aimed to assess whether fish and seafood consumption in pregnancy is associated with childhood wheeze, asthma and allergic rhinitis. Methods: We pooled individual data from 60 774 mother-child pairs participating in 18 European and US birth cohort studies. Information on wheeze, asthma and allergic rhinitis prevalence was collected using validated questionnaires. The time periods of interest were: infancy (0-2 years), preschool age (3-4 years), and school age (5-8 years). We used multivariable generalized models to assess associations of fish and seafood (other than fish) consumption during pregnancy with child respiratory outcomes in cohort-specific analyses, with subsequent random-effects meta-analyses. Results: The median fish consumption during pregnancy ranged from 0.44 times/week in The Netherlands to 4.46 times/week in Spain. Maternal fish intake during pregnancy was not associated with offspring wheeze symptoms in any age group nor with the risk of child asthma [adjusted meta-analysis relative risk (RR) per 1-time/week = 1.01, 95\% confidence interval 0.97-1.05)] and allergic rhinitis at school age (RR = 1.01, 0.99-1.03).

We further validated the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus in 2126 randomly selected pregnancies from the entire Danish National Birth Cohort. From the individual hospital records, an expert panel evaluated gestational diabetes mellitus status based on results from oral glucose tolerance tests, fasting blood glucose and Hb1c values, as well as diagnoses made by local obstetricians. RESULTS: The audit categorized 783 pregnancies as gestational diabetes mellitus, corresponding to 0.89\% of the 87 792 pregnancies for which a pregnancy interview for self-reported diabetes in pregnancy was available. From the randomly selected group the combined information from register and interviews could correctly identify 96\% (95\% CI 80-99.9\%) of all cases in the entire Danish National Birth Cohort population. Positive predictive value, however, was only 59\% (56-61\%). CONCLUSIONS: The combined use of data from register and interview provided a high sensitivity for gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosis. The low positive predictive value, however, suggests that systematic validation by hospital record review is essential not to underestimate the health consequences of gestational diabetes mellitus in future studies.},

Prolonged HL may lead to language delay and cognitive difficulties. However, the consequences of HL due to OM are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to determine the possible association between number of OM episodes in childhood and self-rated school performance controlling for potential confounders. METHODS: Prospectively gathered systematic interview data on OM episodes in early childhood and school performance at 11 years of age were obtained from The Danish National Birth Cohort, involving {\textgreater}100,000 individual pregnancies and their offspring. We defined four exposure groups (0, 1-3, 4-6 and {\textgreater}/=7 OM episodes) and assessed general school performance, mathematics and literacy. Possible confounders were recognized a priori and associations were determined using proportional odds regression. RESULTS: Out of 94,745 successful pregnancies, 35,946 children without malformations and their parents completed a questionnaire at age 11 years. No associations were observed between number of OM episodes and school performance, even in children with {\textgreater}/=7 OM episodes. CONCLUSION: This national birth-cohort study did not support the hypothesis that the number of OM episodes in childhood is associated with reduced self-reported school performance in children at 11 years of age.},

METHODS: HKD diagnosis and ADHD medication use data were obtained from the Danish National Hospital, Central Psychiatric and Pharmaceutical registers. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for HKD diagnosis and ADHD medication use and risk ratios (RRs) for parent-reported ADHD behavior collected with the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), comparing children whose mothers took folic acid or multivitamin supplements early in pregnancy defined as starting periconceptionally (4 weeks prior to their last menstrual period (LMP)) through 8 weeks after their LMP (4-8 weeks), to children whose mothers indicated no supplement use for the same entire period. RESULTS: We identified 384 children (1.1\%) with a hospital diagnosis for HKD and 642 children (1.8\%) treated with ADHD medication. We found no association between risk of HKD diagnosis or intake of ADHD medication and early maternal folic acid use. However, early multivitamin use was associated with an approximately 30\% reduction in risk for HKD diagnosis (aHR: 0.70, 95\% CI: 0.52-0.96) and 21\% reduction in treatment with ADHD medication (aHR: 0.79, 95\% CI: 0.62-0.98). We observed a reduced risk in parent-reported ADHD behaviors, but these results were attenuated after adjustment. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that multivitamin use in early pregnancy may reduce risk for HKD diagnosis and treatment for ADHD in the offspring.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of atopic dermatitis, wheezing, asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis has been increasing. Register-based studies are essential for research in subpopulations with specific diseases and facilitate epidemiological studies to identify causes and evaluate interventions. Algorithms have been developed to identify children with atopic dermatitis, asthma or allergic rhinoconjunctivitis using register information on disease-specific dispensed prescribed medication and hospital contacts, but the validity of the algorithms has not been evaluated. This study validated the algorithms vs gold standard deep telephone interviews with the caretaker about physician-diagnosed atopic dermatitis, wheezing, asthma or allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in the child. METHODS: The algorithms defined each of the three atopic diseases using register-based information on disease-specific hospital contacts and/or filled prescriptions of disease-specific medication. Confirmative answers to questions about physician-diagnosed atopic disease were used as the gold standard for the comparison with the algorithms, resulting in sensitivities and specificities and 95\% confidence intervals. The interviews with the caretaker of the included 454 Danish children born 1997-2003 were carried out May-September 2015; the mean age of the children at the time of the interview being 15.2 years (standard deviation 1.3 years). RESULTS: For the algorithm capturing children with atopic dermatitis, the sensitivity was 74.1\% (95\% confidence interval: 66.9\%-80.2\%) and the specificity 73.0\% (67.3\%-78.0\%). For the algorithm capturing children with asthma, both the sensitivity of 84.1\% (78.0\%-88.8\%) and the specificity of 81.6\% (76.5\%-85.8\%) were high compared with physician-diagnosed asthmatic bronchitis (recurrent wheezing). The sensitivity remained high when capturing physician-diagnosed asthma: 83.3\% (74.3\%-89.6\%); however, the specificity declined to 66.0\% (60.9\%-70.8\%). For allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, the sensitivity was 84.4\% (78.0-89.2) and the specificity 81.6\% (75.0-84.4). CONCLUSION: The algorithms are valid and valuable tools to identify children with atopic dermatitis, wheezing, asthma or allergic rhinoconjunctivitis on a population level using register data.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite extensive research, the aetiology of atopic dermatitis remains largely unknown, but reduced intestinal microbiota diversity in neonates has been linked to subsequent atopic dermatitis. Consequently, postnatal antibiotics have been proposed as a risk factor, but a potential association between prenatal antibiotics and atopic dermatitis is not well studied. Overall, the current evidence suggests a positive association between exposure to prenatal antibiotics and atopic dermatitis. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between prenatal antibiotics and atopic dermatitis among 18-month-old children. METHODS: This study conducted within the Danish National Birth Cohort included 62 560 mother-child pairs. Data on maternal prenatal antibiotics were collected in the 30th gestation week and 6 months post-partum, and offspring atopic dermatitis 18 months post-partum through telephone interviews. Antibiotic use was categorized by the timing of exposure as 1st-2nd trimester (gestation week 0-29), 3rd trimester (gestation week 30-birth), all three trimesters or none. Data were analysed by logistic regression analyses adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Exposure to antibiotics prenatally was associated with increased odds of atopic dermatitis among children born by atopic mothers but only when used in both 1st-2nd and 3rd trimester (ORadj 1.45, 95\% CI: 1.19-1.76). The findings were consistent using different definitions of atopic dermatitis. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Prenatal exposure to antibiotics throughout pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of atopic dermatitis but only within the first 18 months of life among children born by atopic mothers. The clinical usefulness of this finding must rest on corroboration in independent data sources.},

We studied the risk of any inpatient or outpatient psychiatric treatment during the time period from 12 months before to 12 months after fetal death. DESIGN: Cohort study using Danish population-based registers. SETTING: Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1 112 831 women born in Denmark from 1960 to 1995 were included. In total, 87 687cases of fetal death (International Classification of Disease-10 codes for spontaneous abortion or stillbirth) were recorded between 1996 and 2010. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were incidence rate ratios (risk of first psychiatric inpatient or outpatient treatment). RESULTS: A total of 1379 women had at least one psychiatric episode during follow-up from the year before fetal death to the year after. Within the first few months after the loss, women had an increased risk of psychiatric contact, IRR: 1.51 (95\% CI 1.15 to 1.99). In comparison, no increased risk of psychiatric contact was found for the period before fetal death. The risk of experiencing a psychiatric episode was highest for women with a loss occurring after 20 weeks of gestation (12 month probability: 1.95\%, 95\% CI 1.50 to 2.39). CONCLUSIONS: Fetal death was associated with a transient increased risk of experiencing a first-time episode of a psychiatric disorder, primarily adjustment disorders. The risk of psychiatric episodes tended to increase with increasing gestational age at the time of the loss.},

Using national registry data to obtain end point information on all members of the cohort, we estimated associations in the baseline and the 7-year follow-up participant populations for 5 exposure-outcome associations: (a) size at birth and childhood asthma, (b) assisted reproductive treatment and childhood hospitalizations, (c) prepregnancy body mass index and childhood infections, (d) alcohol drinking in early pregnancy and childhood developmental disorders, and (e) maternal smoking in pregnancy and childhood attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We estimated follow-up bias in the odds or rate ratios by calculating relative ratios. For all but one of the above analyses, the bias appeared to be small, between -10\% and +8\%. For maternal smoking in pregnancy and childhood ADHD, we estimated a positive bias of approximately 33\% (95\% bootstrap limits of -30\% and +152\%). The presence and magnitude of bias due to loss to follow-up depended on the nature of the factors or outcomes examined, with the most pronounced contribution in this study coming from maternal smoking.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Women planning to conceive are often advised to take multivitamins. Whether this affects the survival of the fetus is not known. METHODS: We used data from 35 914 women in the Danish National Birth Cohort who at recruitment had reported the number of weeks of supplement use during a 12-week periconceptional period. A telephone interview provided information about maternal characteristics and data on fetal death came from registers. The associations between periconceptional multivitamin or folate-only use and early ({\textless}20 weeks) and late ({\textgreater}/=20 weeks) fetal death were estimated by hazard ratios (HR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Follow-up started at 8 completed weeks of gestation, and comparisons were made with no supplement use at any time during the periconceptional period. RESULTS: Any multivitamin use was associated with a small increased crude risk of fetal death [HR 1.12 (1.01-1.25)], which was restricted to early losses [HR 1.18 (1.05-1.33)] compared with late losses [HR 0.82 (0.62-1.10)]. Adjustment for maternal factors increased this excess risk further. Whereas regular users of multivitamins (4-6 weeks of 6) before conception had more early losses [HR 1.29 (1.12-1.48)], a decreased risk of late losses was indicated when use started after conception [HR 0.65 (0.39-1.09)]. Folate-only use was not associated with fetal death. CONCLUSIONS: Multivitamin use was associated with a modest increased risk of early fetal death. For late fetal death, regular supplement use after conception may decrease risk, but numbers were small. Further studies on preconceptional multivitamin use are needed to guide public health recommendations.},

METHODS: Prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and fetal death were examined in the Danish National Birth Cohort among 54,505 pregnant women who participated in a comprehensive interview during the second trimester. Pregnancy outcomes were obtained from registers and medical records. Cox regression analyses with delayed entry and time-dependent covariates were used to estimate the risk of fetal death. RESULTS: Compared with normal-weight women (18.5 {\textless} or = BMI {\textless} 25), the risks of fetal death among obese women (BMI {\textgreater} or = 30), expressed as adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were as follows: before week 14: 0.8 (0.5-1.4), weeks 14-19: 1.6 (1.0-2.5), weeks 20-27: 1.9 (1.1-3.3), weeks 28-36: 2.1 (1.0-4.4), weeks 37-39: 3.5 (1.9-6.4), and weeks 40+: 4.6 (1.6-13.4). Overweight women (25 {\textless} or = BMI {\textless} 30) also experienced a higher risk after 28 weeks, and especially after 40 weeks of gestation (HR 2.9, 95\% CI 1.1-7.7). Analysis of stillbirth (fetal death at 28+ completed weeks of gestation) indicated that the effects were not due to obesity-related diseases in pregnancy, nor was weight gain associated with stillbirth. The increased risk of stillbirth among overweight and obese women was partly attributable to inadequate placental function (crude odds ratios 2.1, 95\% CI 1.0-4.4, and 5.2, 95\% CI 2.5-10.9, respectively).

Three reviewers independently extracted the studies' characteristics and outcome data. RESULTS: Of 225 identified abstracts, 4 primary studies met our inclusion criteria by comparing spontaneous pregnant patients with endometriosis to disease-free women. Miscarriage rate was higher in the endometriosis group (OR 1.77 [CI 95\% 1.13-2.78]).

RESULTS: Women with anatomic abnormalities had a higher rate of previous cesarean section (18.8\% vs. 8.6\%, P=0.022), tended to have a lower number of previous live births (1.05 vs. 1.37, P=0.07), and a higher rate of preterm delivery (22.9\% vs. 10\%, P=0.037). Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, anatomic abnormality was identified as an independent risk factor for RPL in patients with previous cesarean section after controlling for place of residence, positive genetic/autoimmune/endocrine workup, and fertility problems (OR 7.22; 95\% CI 1.17-44.54, P=0.03). Women suffering from anatomic abnormalities tended to have a higher rate of pregnancy loss compared to those without anatomic abnormalities (40\% vs. 30.9\%, P=0.2). The difference in pregnancy loss rate among women who underwent surgical correction compared to those who did not was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: In patients with previous cesarean section, uterine abnormality is an independent risk factor for pregnancy loss. Surgical correction of uterine abnormalities among RPL patients might have the potential to improve live birth rate.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Research on the treatment of second-trimester miscarriages is scarce. We studied the outcomes, and the factors associated with adverse events and need for hospital resources in the medical treatment of second-trimester miscarriage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In these retrospective analyses we studied women treated for spontaneous fetal miscarriage with misoprostol-only (n = 24) or mifepristone and misoprostol (n = 177) in duration of gestation 12+1-21+6. Primary outcomes were the risk factors for surgical evacuation and excessive bleeding. Secondary outcomes were total misoprostol dose, time to expulsion and the length of hospital stay. RESULTS: History of surgical evacuation of the uterus increased the risk of surgical evacuation (p = 0.027). Excessive bleeding was not associated with any of the studied variables. More misoprostol was needed when the duration of gestation exceeded 17+0 weeks (p = 0.036). In multivariate analysis the time to fetal expulsion was shorter in women with history of 1-2 deliveries (hazard ratio [HR] 1.49, 95\% confidence interval [CI]; 1.07-2.07), {\textgreater}/=3 deliveries (HR 1.63, 95\% CI; 1.11-2.38) and with a two-day interval between mifepristone-misoprostol administration (HR 1.71, 95\% CI; 1.05-2.81). Patients with symptoms (i.e. uterine bleeding or pain) at baseline had longer hospital stay (HR 0.66, 95\% CI; 0.47-0.92). CONCLUSIONS: The factors affecting the outcomes of medical treatment of second-trimester fetal miscarriage are similar to those of second-trimester induced abortion. Two-day interval between mifepristone-misoprostol administration might decrease the time to fetal expulsion and the need of hospital resources.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prospectively the relationship between prepregnancy folate intake and risk of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth. METHODS: Women in the Nurses' Health Study II who self-reported a pregnancy between 1992 and 2009 were included in this analysis. Dietary folate and supplement use was assessed every 4 years, starting in 1991, by a food frequency questionnaire. Pregnancies were self-reported with case pregnancies lost spontaneously (spontaneous abortion less than 20 weeks of gestation and stillbirth 20+ weeks of gestation) and comparison pregnancies ending in ectopic pregnancy, induced abortion, or live birth. RESULTS: Among the 11,072 women, 15,950 pregnancies were reported of which 2,756 (17.3\%) ended in spontaneous abortion and 120 (0.8\%) ended in stillbirth. Compared with women in the lowest quintile of prepregnancy folate intake (less than 285 micrograms/d), those in the highest quintile (greater than 851 micrograms/d) had a relative risk of spontaneous abortion of 0.91 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.82-1.02) after multivariable adjustment (P trend=.04). This association was primarily attributable to intake of folate from supplements. Compared with women without supplemental folate intake (0 micrograms/d), those in the highest category (greater than 730 micrograms/d) had a relative risk of spontaneous abortion of 0.80 (95\% CI 0.71-0.90) after multivariable adjustment (P trend {\textless}.001). The association of prepregnancy supplemental folate with risk of spontaneous abortion was consistent across gestational period of loss. A similar inverse trend was observed with the risk of stillbirth, which fell short of conventional significance (P trend=.06). CONCLUSIONS: Higher intake of folate from supplements was associated with reduced risk of spontaneous abortion. Women at risk of pregnancy should use supplemental folate for neural tube defect prevention and because it may decrease the risk of spontaneous abortion. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: : II.},

	abstract = {AIM: The aim of the study was to characterize the extent of indication bias resulting from the excessive use of NSAIDs on the days preceding a spontaneous abortion to relieve pain. METHODS: We used data from a retrospective cohort study assessing the risk for spontaneous abortions following exposure to NSAIDs. Three definitions of exposure for cases of spontaneous abortions were compared, from the first day of pregnancy until the day of spontaneous abortion and until 3 and 2 days before a spontaneous abortion. Statistical analysis was performed using multivariate time programmed Cox regression. RESULTS: A sharp increase was observed in the dispensation of indomethacin, diclofenac and naproxen, and a milder increase was found in the use of ibuprofen during the week before a spontaneous abortion. Non- selective COX inhibitors in general and specifically diclofenac and indomethacin were found to be associated with spontaneous abortions when the exposure period was defined until the day of spontaneous abortion (hazard ratio (HR) 1.15, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.04, 1.28; HR 1.31, 95\% CI 1.08, 1.59 and HR 3.33, 95\% CI 2.09, 5.29, respectively). The effect disappears by excluding exposures occurring on the day before the spontaneous abortion for non-selective COX inhibitors and on the last week before the spontaneous abortion for indomethacin. In general, decreasing HRs were found with the exclusion of exposures occurring on the days immediately before the spontaneous abortion. CONCLUSIONS: The increased use of NSAIDs during the last few days that preceded a spontaneous abortion to relieve pain associated with the miscarriage could bias studies assessing the association between exposure to NSAIDs and spontaneous abortions.},

METHODS: The databases MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for Nordic epidemiological studies published between January 1980 and August 2007 about the association between social indicators and the outcomes spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or perinatal mortality. Thirty-five studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were identified for this review. RESULTS: Social differences in stillbirth and perinatal mortality were found in all of the identified Finnish and Norwegian studies and in the majority of studies from Denmark, whereas in the Swedish studies the findings were less consistent. As only a small number of studies on spontaneous abortion were identified (n=3), no conclusions were drawn with regard to this outcome. CONCLUSIONS: There seems to be a reasonable body of evidence that social inequality in stillbirth and perinatal mortality exists in Norway, Finland and Denmark, whereas the conclusions regarding Sweden are more uncertain. A number of methodological problems complicate the comparison of the findings. Nordic collaborative analyses of social gradients in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and perinatal mortality, which take these methodological concerns into account, are needed in order to draw inferences across countries.},

We aimed to investigate the association between fertility treatment and childhood epilepsy, including specific types of treatment and indications, as well as subtypes of epilepsy. METHODS: In this nationwide birth cohort study, we included all pregnancies in Denmark resulting in live-born singletons, 1995-2003. Children conceived by fertility treatment and children developing epilepsy (until 2013) were identified from Danish national registers. RESULTS: A total of 565,116 pregnancies were included; 8,071 children (1.4\%) developed epilepsy. Children conceived after ovulation induction or intrauterine insemination had a slightly higher risk of childhood epilepsy (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.15; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00, 1.31). The association was more pronounced for the subtypes idiopathic generalized and focal epilepsy. Regarding the specific hormonal treatments, only clomiphene citrate was associated with an increased risk of childhood epilepsy, also in a sibling analysis (HR: 2.07; 95\% CI: 1.05, 4.08). In vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection was not associated with an overall increased risk of childhood epilepsy but with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (HR: 1.43; 95\% CI: 0.99, 2.05). No clear associations were seen regarding other treatment types or indications. CONCLUSIONS: Children conceived by ovulation induction or intrauterine insemination with clomiphene citrate may be at slightly increased risk of childhood epilepsy. Furthermore, children conceived by in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection may be at slightly increased risk of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.},

A total of 88,482 pregnant women recruited from March 1996 to November 2002 participated in a comprehensive interview on coffee consumption and potentially confounding factors in pregnancy. Information on pregnancy outcome was obtained from the National Hospital Discharge Register and medical records. The authors detected 1,102 fetal deaths. High levels of coffee consumption were associated with an increased risk of fetal death. Relative to nonconsumers of coffee, the adjusted hazard ratios for fetal death associated with coffee consumption of 1/2-3, 4-7, and {\textgreater} or =8 cups of coffee per day were 1.03 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.89, 1.19), 1.33 (95\% CI: 1.08, 1.63), and 1.59 (95\% CI: 1.19, 2.13), respectively. Reverse causation due to unrecognized fetal demise may explain the association between coffee intake and risk of fetal death prior to 20 completed weeks' gestation but not the association with fetal loss following 20 completed weeks' gestation.

DESIGN: Retrospective application of ICD-PM. SETTING: South Africa, UK. POPULATION: Perinatal death databases. METHODS: Deaths were grouped according to timing of death and then by the ICD-PM cause of death. The main maternal condition at the time of perinatal death was assigned to each case. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Causes of perinatal mortality, associated maternal conditions. RESULTS: In South Africa 344/689 (50\%) deaths occurred antepartum, 11\% (n = 74) intrapartum and 39\% (n = 271) in the early neonatal period. In the UK 4377/9067 (48.3\%) deaths occurred antepartum, with 457 (5\%) intrapartum and 4233 (46.7\%) in the neonatal period. Antepartum deaths were due to unspecified causes (59\%), chromosomal abnormalities (21\%) or problems related to fetal growth (14\%). Intrapartum deaths followed acute intrapartum events (69\%); neonatal deaths followed consequences of low birthweight/ prematurity (31\%), chromosomal abnormalities (26\%), or unspecified causes in healthy mothers (25\%). Mothers were often healthy; 53\%, 38\% and 45\% in the antepartum, intrapartum and neonatal death groups, respectively. Where there was a maternal condition, it was most often maternal medical conditions, and complications of placenta, cord and membranes. CONCLUSIONS: The ICD-PM can be a globally applicable perinatal death classification system that emphasises the need for a focus on the mother-baby dyad as we move beyond 2015.

	abstract = {The 'birthweight paradox' describes the phenomenon whereby birthweight-specific mortality curves cross when stratified on other exposures, most notably cigarette smoking. The paradox has been noted widely in the literature and numerous explanations and corrections have been suggested. Recently, causal diagrams have been used to illustrate the possibility for collider-stratification bias in models adjusting for birthweight. When two variables share a common effect, stratification on the variable representing that effect induces a statistical relation between otherwise independent factors. This bias has been proposed to explain the birthweight paradox. Causal diagrams may illustrate sources of bias, but are limited to describing qualitative effects. In this paper, we provide causal diagrams that illustrate the birthweight paradox and use a simulation study to quantify the collider-stratification bias under a range of circumstances. Considered circumstances include exposures with and without direct effects on neonatal mortality, as well as with and without indirect effects acting through birthweight on neonatal mortality. The results of these simulations illustrate that when the birthweight-mortality relation is subject to substantial uncontrolled confounding, the bias on estimates of effect adjusted for birthweight may be sufficient to yield opposite causal conclusions, i.e. a factor that poses increased risk appears protective. Effects on stratum-specific birthweight-mortality curves were considered to illustrate the connection between collider-stratification bias and the crossing of the curves. The simulations demonstrate the conditions necessary to give rise to empirical evidence of the paradox.},

	abstract = {Advanced paternal age has been associated with a variety of rare conditions and diseases of great public health impact. An increased number of de novo point mutations in sperm with increasing age have been suggested as a mechanism, which would likely also affect fetal viability. We examined the association between paternal age and stillbirth rate in a large nationwide cohort. We identified all pregnancies in Denmark from 1994 to 2010 carried to a gestational age of at least 22 completed weeks (n = 944,031) as registered in national registers and linked to individual register data about the parents. The hazard ratio of stillbirth according to paternal age was estimated, adjusted for maternal age in 1-year categories, year of outcome, and additionally parental educational levels. The relative rate of stillbirth (n = 4946) according to paternal age was found to be J-shaped with the highest hazard ratio for fathers aged more than 40 years when paternal age was modelled using restricted cubic splines. When modelled categorically, the adjusted hazard ratios of stillbirth were as follows: {\textless}25, 1.16 (95\% confidence interval, CI 1.01-1.34); 25-29, 1.03 (95\% CI 0.95-1.11); 35-39, 1.16 (95\% CI 1.07-1.26); 40-44, 1.41 (95\% CI 1.26-1.59); 45-49, 1.20 (95\% CI 0.97-1.49); 50+, 1.58 (95\% CI 1.18-2.11), compared with fathers aged 30-34 years. These estimates attenuated slightly when further adjusted for parental education. Our study showed that paternal age was associated with the relative rate of stillbirth in a J-shaped manner with the highest hazard ratios among fathers aged more than 40 years.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The long-term safety of surgical abortion in the first trimester is well established. Despite the increasing use of medical abortion (abortion by means of medication), limited information is available regarding the effects of this procedure on subsequent pregnancies. METHODS: We identified all women living in Denmark who had undergone an abortion for nonmedical reasons between 1999 and 2004 and obtained information regarding subsequent pregnancies from national registries. Risks of ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, preterm birth (at {\textless}37 weeks of gestation), and low birth weight ({\textless}2500 g) in the first subsequent pregnancy in women who had had a first-trimester medical abortion were compared with risks in women who had had a first-trimester surgical abortion. RESULTS: Among 11,814 pregnancies in women who had had a previous first-trimester medical abortion (2710 women) or surgical abortion (9104 women), there were 274 ectopic pregnancies (respective incidence rates, 2.4\% and 2.3\%), 1426 spontaneous abortions (12.2\% and 12.7\%), 552 preterm births (5.4\% and 6.7\%), and 478 births with low birth weight (4.0\% and 5.1\%). After adjustment for maternal age, interval between pregnancies, gestational age at abortion, parity, cohabitation status, and urban or nonurban residence, medical abortion was not associated with a significantly increased risk of ectopic pregnancy (relative risk, 1.04; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 1.41), spontaneous abortion (relative risk, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.72 to 1.05), preterm birth (relative risk, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.66 to 1.18), or low birth weight (relative risk, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.61 to 1.11). Gestational age at medical abortion was not significantly associated with any of these adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that a previous medical abortion, as compared with a previous surgical abortion, increases the risk of spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, preterm birth, or low birth weight.},

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study based on the Danish Centre for Strategic Research in Type 2 Diabetes cohort. We examined the prevalence ratios (PR) of demographic, lifestyle, anthropometric, and clinical factors according to parental history, using Poisson regression adjusting for age and gender. RESULTS: Of 2825 T2D patients, 34\% (n = 964) had a parental history of T2D. Parental history was associated with younger age at diagnosis [adjusted (a)PR 1.66, 95\% confidence interval: 1.19, 2.31) for age {\textless}40 years; aPR 1.36 (95\% confidence interval: 1.24, 1.48) for ages 40-59 years] and with higher baseline fasting plasma glucose [{\textgreater}/=7.5 mmol/L, aPR 1.47 (95\% confidence interval: 1.20, 1.80)], and also tended to be associated with lower beta cell function. In contrast, patients both with and without a parental history had similar occurrence of central obesity [91\% vs. 91\%], weight gain {\textgreater}/=30 kg since age 20 [52\% vs. 53\%], and lack of regular physical activity [60\% vs. 58\%]. Presence of diabetes complications or comorbidities at T2D diagnosis was not associated with parental history. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of an association between parental history and adverse lifestyle factors indicates that T2D patients do not inherit a particular propensity for overeating or inactivity, whereas patients with a parental history may have more severe pancreatic beta cell dysfunction at diagnosis.},

We therefore examined the positive predictive value (PPV) of cardiovascular diagnoses in the DNPR. DESIGN: Population-based validation study. SETTING: 1 university hospital and 2 regional hospitals in the Central Denmark Region, 2010-2012. PARTICIPANTS: For each cardiovascular diagnosis, up to 100 patients from participating hospitals were randomly sampled during the study period using the DNPR. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Using medical record review as the reference standard, we examined the PPV for cardiovascular diagnoses in the DNPR, coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. RESULTS: A total of 2153 medical records (97\% of the total sample) were available for review. The PPVs ranged from 64\% to 100\%, with a mean PPV of 88\%. The PPVs were {\textgreater}/=90\% for first-time myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, stable angina pectoris, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, takotsubo cardiomyopathy, arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation or flutter, cardiac arrest, mitral valve regurgitation or stenosis, aortic valve regurgitation or stenosis, pericarditis, hypercholesterolaemia, aortic dissection, aortic aneurysm/dilation and arterial claudication. The PPVs were between 80\% and 90\% for recurrent myocardial infarction, first-time unstable angina pectoris, pulmonary hypertension, bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, endocarditis, cardiac tumours, first-time venous thromboembolism and between 70\% and 80\% for first-time and recurrent admission due to heart failure, first-time dilated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy and recurrent venous thromboembolism. The PPV for first-time myocarditis was 64\%. The PPVs were consistent within age, sex, calendar year and hospital categories. CONCLUSIONS: The validity of cardiovascular diagnoses in the DNPR is overall high and sufficient for use in research since 2010.},

The aim of the present study was to explore the association between number of induced and spontaneous abortions and the risk of uterine fibroids in middle-aged and older Chinese women. METHODS: A total of 14,595 retired female employees from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort study were included in our analysis. Information on induced and spontaneous abortions was collected by trained interviewers through face-to-face interviews. Diagnosis of uterine fibroids was based on ultrasound or self-reported physician diagnosis of uterine fibroids. Logistic regression models were used to explore the associations between number of induced and spontaneous abortions and the risk of uterine fibroids. RESULTS: The prevalence of uterine fibroids was 15.1\% among all participants. Higher number of induced abortions was associated with an increased risk of uterine fibroids (1 induced abortion: odds ratios [ORs] = 1.32, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-1.48; 2 induced abortions: OR = 1.45, 95\% CI 1.28-1.64; and {\textgreater}/=3 induced abortions: OR = 1.62, 95\% CI 1.39-1.90). Compared with women without induced abortion, ORs for women with 1, 2, and {\textgreater}/=3 were 1.17 (95\% CI 1.03-1.32), 1.21 (95\% CI 1.06-1.39), and 1.36 (95\% CI 1.15-1.61), respectively, after adjustment for potential confounders. No association was observed between the number of spontaneous abortions and the risk of uterine fibroids. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study showed that induced abortion may be an independent risk factor for uterine fibroids in middle-aged and older Chinese women.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR) is one of the world's oldest nationwide hospital registries and is used extensively for research. Many studies have validated algorithms for identifying health events in the DNPR, but the reports are fragmented and no overview exists. OBJECTIVES: To review the content, data quality, and research potential of the DNPR. METHODS: We examined the setting, history, aims, content, and classification systems of the DNPR. We searched PubMed and the Danish Medical Journal to create a bibliography of validation studies. We included also studies that were referenced in retrieved papers or known to us beforehand. Methodological considerations related to DNPR data were reviewed. RESULTS: During 1977-2012, the DNPR registered 8,085,603 persons, accounting for 7,268,857 inpatient, 5,953,405 outpatient, and 5,097,300 emergency department contacts. The DNPR provides nationwide longitudinal registration of detailed administrative and clinical data. It has recorded information on all patients discharged from Danish nonpsychiatric hospitals since 1977 and on psychiatric inpatients and emergency department and outpatient specialty clinic contacts since 1995. For each patient contact, one primary and optional secondary diagnoses are recorded according to the International Classification of Diseases. The DNPR provides a data source to identify diseases, examinations, certain in-hospital medical treatments, and surgical procedures. Long-term temporal trends in hospitalization and treatment rates can be studied. The positive predictive values of diseases and treatments vary widely ({\textless}15\%-100\%). The DNPR data are linkable at the patient level with data from other Danish administrative registries, clinical registries, randomized controlled trials, population surveys, and epidemiologic field studies - enabling researchers to reconstruct individual life and health trajectories for an entire population. CONCLUSION: The DNPR is a valuable tool for epidemiological research. However, both its strengths and limitations must be considered when interpreting research results, and continuous validation of its clinical data is essential.},

In-person interviews were completed with 1,459 incident breast cancer cases ascertained through a population-based cancer registry, and 1,556 controls randomly selected from the general population in Shanghai (with respective response rates of 91\% and 90\%). After adjusting for confounding, there was no relation between ever having had an induced abortion and breast cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 0.9, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.7-1.2).

METHODS: We randomly selected patients registered in the DNRP with a diagnosis of SA between 1980 and 2008 from hospitals in the county of North Jutland and searched for their discharge records in hospital files. We estimated positive predictive value (PPV) of the DNRP diagnosis and stratified the analysis by period (1980-1994 versus 1995-2008), hospital type (regional versus local), and International Classification of Diseases revisions (ICD-8 versus ICD-10). RESULTS: We could identify hospital files of 117/174 (67\%) sampled registration records. Of those, the diagnosis was confirmed in 114 patients, yielding a PPV of 97.4\% (95\% confidence interval = 92.7\%-99.5\%). The PPV did not markedly vary by period, hospital type, or ICD revision. Among the three patients with available data who did not fulfill the criteria for SA, one had an induced abortion and two had threatened abortion but did not miscarry.

E3N is a large-scale cohort study collecting detailed information on environmental and reproductive factors. We investigated the relation between breast cancer and a history of induced and/or spontaneous abortion, using the data from the 100,000 women aged 40-65 at entrance in 1990. Among them, over 2,600 new invasive breast cancers had been diagnosed by June 2000. Multivariate analysis, adjusted for known potential confounders, showed no association between a history of induced abortion and breast cancer risk either in the whole population (relative risk [RR] = 0.91, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.82-0.99) or in subgroups defined by parity or by menopausal status. Overall, the association between spontaneous abortion and breast cancer was not significant (RR = 1.05, 95\% CI 0.95-1.15). However, there is a suggestion of increased risk with increased number of miscarriages (RR = 1.20, 95\% CI 0.92-1.56 after 3 or more). Moreover, an interaction with menopausal status was observed. In premenopause, the risk decreased with increasing number of spontaneous abortions, whereas it increased in postmenopause. Among nulliparous and parous women, the relative risk estimates were respectively equal to 1.16 (95\% CI 1.04-1.30, p trend {\textless} 0.0008) and 1.14 (95\% CI 1.01-1.28, p trend = 0.005). Premenopausal breast cancer, on the other hand, appeared to be less frequent in women who had had repeated miscarriages. We conclude that there is no relationship between breast cancer and induced abortion but that an association with spontaneous abortion is possible and may depend on menopausal status.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between socio-economic factors and use of prescription medication during pregnancy in a population of Danish women. METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study. Using record linkage from public administrative registries, we described the use of prescription medication during pregnancy and the financial and educational resources for each pregnant woman in the cohort. RESULTS: The analyses included all 19,874 primiparous women delivering singletons in North Jutland county, Denmark, in 1991-1998. We identified 24,243 prescriptions filled by the women during their pregnancies. The highest overall prescription medication use was among women with basic schooling (OR 1.3; 95\% CI 1.2-1.4), and lowest among women with the highest education (OR: 0.8; 95\% CI 0.7-0.9) compared with women who had vocational education. Stratified analysis of therapeutic subgroups revealed that socio-economic factors were associated with the use of anti-infective and anti-asthmatic medications during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Maternal educational level, and to a lesser degree household income, paternal educational level and cohabitation status, was associated with the use of prescription medication during pregnancy. However, the analyses did not take into account important clinical variables such as maternal illness, and the results could be affected by differential misclassification of exposure information, by confounding or chance.},

	abstract = {Reproductive epidemiologists study disease outcomes over three time periods: (i) from conception, or before, to birth, (ii) from birth to death and (iii) from death and into the next generations. They have traditionally been short of data from the time of conception to birth, and we use data at birth to estimate fetal growth or the incidence of congenital malformations. Although we are interested in incidence data for defects that start early in gestation, we have to use prevalence data at birth. Cumulative incidence will only be similar to prevalence at birth given no competing risks - or no fetal death after the onset of the lesion. Routinely use of ultrasound methods in fetal medicine will change our monitoring of structural birth defects. We may now be able to link exposures to events with the right time sequence, for example on fetal growth deviations and get better data on fetal deaths also for twins and triplets. The scientific challenges will mainly come from induced abortions following ultrasound examinations. Ultrasound data from the time of pregnancy will be of crucial importance for studies on fetal programming or "developmental origins of health and disease" (DOHaD). In humans, babies that are small at birth have an increased risk of, eg, cardiovascular disease, as shown by DJ Barker in the 1980s (1), but this association is probably not a direct consequence of the low birth weight but rather caused by external or internal exposures during fetal life. DOHaD studies that use outcomes at birth, including weight, as exposures or intermediates may be biased. One notorious example is the apparent protective effect of smoking on the mortality of children with a low birth weight (2). This bias, partly related to collider stratification bias, is potentially less important in studies using direct ultrasound assessments. The risk of reverse causation may also be reduced in longitudinal studies based on ultrasound data. Fetal ultrasound examinations are also done to detect fetal structural abnormalities in order to start early treatment or terminate an effected pregnancy if that is permitted and requested by the parents. This change in timing and validity of determining congenital abnormalities (CA) will have substantial consequences for our monitoring of CA over time. Most of the existing monitoring systems are based on measuring prevalence of CA at time of birth, often allowing for a time period of detection from months to years since some of the CA are not detected at birth. They may be detected by ultrasound during gestation, but even for CA detectable in gestational weeks 20-24 and at birth, the sensitivity and specificity of times of diagnosing may differ so much that the measures are not comparable. Furthermore, the time from ultrasound to birth is sometimes interrupted by late fetal deaths and some of these deaths may be induced on indication. In any case, it will be difficult to reestablish long-term monitoring trends by applying birth correcting factors that will differ by the type of CA. We probably have to accept that long-term time trends need years to be reestablished and will have to be based on updated diagnostic facilities that will change over time. It may be difficult to spot increases in the incidence of CA in the future. An increase could be real or related to better diagnostic facilities operating in the time period from conception to birth. Fetal medicine will sometimes make it possible to study causes and events in the proper time sequence, which is important since a cause has to precede an event as the only sine qua non causal criteria. Measurements of recurrence "risks" of CA in families have always been complicated. It is well known that several CA have a tendency to be repeated in a subsequent pregnancy, most likely related to genetic factors or other time stable environmental exposures. Better diagnostic facilities with an option for an induced abortion may encourage high-risk parents to try to become pregnant and this may affect estimates of recurrence risk. In any case, calculating recurrence risk for newborns following siblings with the CA in question will probably no longer work (maybe it never worked) since the desire to reach a given family size depends on many factors, including the perceived risk of a CA. Access to prenatal diagnostic data may therefore well produce data closer to recurrence risk than data recorded at the time of birth. Pediatrics and Perinatal Epidemiology recently published a series of papers initiated by Olga Basso (3, 4) addressing in part the problem of moving from time scale one (starting at conception) to time scale two (starting at birth). Part of the addressed problems relate to a lack of options for starting observations on causal factors at the onset of exposure or, at best, before exposure. If that exposure happens early in fetal life, outcomes will be complicated by fetal deaths that probably end observation for {\textgreater}/=30\% of subjects. That equals mortality rates we see for {\textgreater}/=95-year-olds or equals a cumulative death risk seen for newborns from birth to {\textgreater}/=65 years of age. If the exposure of interest is related to fetal death that opens up for strong collider stratification bias and selection when we condition on survival in our analyses for observations at the beginning of the second time scale (5). A negative association on that time scale need not reflect "prevention" in any sense other than suicides early in life will prevent later cancer deaths. It is difficult to imagine a counterfactual comparison to an exposed had he/she not been exposed and had survived fetal life. Those who were susceptible did not all survive. If we study fetal programming of adult diseases, we have to "condition on birth" in our studies, but we should be aware of the selection bias that follows. Fetal medicine will in many ways produce better data or data we never have had before, but it will change the conditions in many aspects of reproductive epidemiology. The main advantage in analytical epidemiology is to get the time sequence right from exposure to outcome to avoid the problem of reverse causation and to do proper mediation analyses.

Illustrative examples of studies addressing perinatal health outcomes (pregnancy complications and fetal and infant health) of a variety of exposures during pregnancy, as well as examples showing different methodological approaches in design and analyses of the studies, are presented. RESEARCH TOPICS: The exposures of interest include alcohol drinking, coffee intake, smoking, use of nicotine substitutes, physical exercise, working conditions, medication and infections during pregnancy, and environmental possible toxins. The study designs cover straightforward cohort analyses, case-control studies and sub-cohort analyses with enriched data collection. CONCLUSION: So far, the Danish National Birth Cohort has provided important knowledge for evidence-based antenatal care by giving more accurate risk estimates for adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with the exposures of interest. Some new potential hazardous exposures during pregnancy have been identified and others have been put to rest. We believe that this investment in epidemiologic infrastructure was well spent. The existence of the Danish National Birth Cohort together with other cohorts and national registers has given Denmark a leading position in reproductive epidemiology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Q fever is a bacterial zoonosis caused by infection with Coxiella burnetii. It is well established that Q fever causes fetal loss in small ruminants. The suspicion has been raised that pregnant women may also experience adverse pregnancy outcome when the infection is acquired or reactivated during pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to assess the potential association between serologic markers of infection with C. burnetii and spontaneous abortion. METHODS: A nested case-control study within the Danish National Birth Cohort, a cohort of 100,418 pregnancies recruited from 1996-2002. Women were recruited in first trimester of pregnancy and followed prospectively. Median gestational age at enrolment was 8 weeks (25 and 75 percentiles: 7 weeks; 10 weeks). During pregnancy, a blood sample was collected at gestational week 6-12 and stored in a bio bank. For this study, a case sample of 218 pregnancies was drawn randomly among the pregnancies in the cohort which ended with a miscarriage before 22 gestational weeks, and a reference group of 482 pregnancies was selected in a random fashion among all pregnancies in the cohort. From these pregnancies, serum samples were screened for antibodies against C. burnetii in a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Samples that proved IgG or IgM antibody positive were subsequently confirmatory tested by an immunofluorescence (IFA) test. RESULTS: Among cases, 11 (5\%) were C. burnetii positive in ELISA of which one was confirmed in the IFA assay compared to 29 (6\%) ELISA positive and 3 IFA confirmed in the random sample. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of a higher prevalence of C. burnetii antibodies in serum samples from women who later miscarried and the present study does not indicate a major association between Q fever infection and spontaneous abortion in humans. Very early first trimester abortions were, however, not included in the study.},

STUDY DESIGN: Using two example "focal" hospitals, each hospital's patients were matched to 10 very similar patients selected from 619 other hospitals. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: All patients were used at each focal hospital, and we found the 10 closest matched patients from control hospitals with exactly the same principal procedure as each focal patient. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We achieved exact matches on all procedures and very close matches for other patient characteristics for both hospitals. There were few to no differences between each hospital's patients and their matched control patients on most patient characteristics, yet large and significant differences were observed for mortality, failure-to-rescue, and cost. CONCLUSION: Indirect standardization matching can produce fair audits of quality and cost, allowing for a comprehensive, transparent, and relevant assessment of all patients at a focal hospital.

Surveillance for HCC among patients with cirrhosis who do not have hepatitis B is cost effective only if the expected risk of HCC exceeds 1.5\% per year. We performed a prospective study to determine the incidence of HCC among patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and to identify risk factors. METHODS: We analyzed data from a surveillance program of 450 patients, aged 40 to 75 years, with alcoholic cirrhosis of Child-Pugh class A or B; patients were enrolled at the liver unit of a tertiary center from September 1992 through March 2010. Data were collected on 20 demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables at the start of the study. Patients were examined every 3 to 6 months for 5 years to identify risk factors for HCC; incidence was determined from a median follow-up time of 42 months. RESULTS: Over the follow-up period, 62 patients developed HCC (43 in the first 5 y of follow-up evaluation), with an annual incidence of 2.6\%. By using multivariate analysis, age 55 years and older (hazard ratio, 2.39; 95\% confidence interval, 1.27-4.51) and platelet counts less than 125 x 10(3)/mm(3) (hazard ratio, 3.29; 95\% confidence interval, 1.39-7.85) were associated independently with the development of HCC. These variables were used to define 3 risk groups. The annual incidence of HCC in the group without either of these factors was 0.3\% (n = 93), the annual incidence with 1 factor was 2.6\% (n = 228), and the annual incidence with both factors was 4.8\% (n = 129) (P {\textless} .0001). CONCLUSIONS: The annual incidence of HCC among patients with alcoholic cirrhosis of Child-Pugh class A or B is around 2.5\%.

The extent of overestimation (or its clinical significance) has been questioned, and CRs methods are infrequently used. This meta-analysis compares the Kaplan-Meier method to the cumulative incidence function (CIF), a CRs method. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS Previews, Web of Science (1992-2016), and article bibliographies for studies estimating cumulative incidence using the Kaplan-Meier method and CIF. For studies with sufficient data, we calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) comparing Kaplan-Meier and CIF estimates using DerSimonian and Laird random effects models. We performed stratified meta-analyses by clinical area, rate of CRs (CRs/events of interest), and follow-up time. RESULTS: Of 2,192 identified abstracts, we included 77 studies in the systematic review and meta-analyzed 55. The pooled RR demonstrated the Kaplan-Meier estimate was 1.41 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.36, 1.47] times higher than the CIF. Overestimation was highest among studies with high rates of CRs [RR = 2.36 (95\% CI: 1.79, 3.12)], studies related to hepatology [RR = 2.60 (95\% CI: 2.12, 3.19)], and obstetrics and gynecology [RR = 1.84 (95\% CI: 1.52, 2.23)]. CONCLUSION: The Kaplan-Meier method overestimated the cumulative incidence across 10 clinical areas. Using CRs methods will ensure accurate results inform clinical and policy decisions.},

	abstract = {Preterm birth is commonly defined as any birth before 37 weeks completed weeks of gestation. An estimated 15 million infants are born preterm globally, disproportionately affecting low and middle income countries (LMIC). It contributes directly to estimated one million neonatal deaths annually and is a significant contributor to childhood morbidity. However, in many clinical settings, the information available to calculate completed weeks of gestation varies widely. Accurate dating of the last menstrual period (LMP), as well as access to clinical and ultrasonographic evaluation are important components of gestational age assessment antenatally. This case definition assign levels of confidence to categorisation of births as preterm, utilising assessment modalities which may be available across different settings. These are designed to enable systematic safety evaluation of vaccine clinical trials and post-implementation programmes of immunisations in pregnancy.},

	abstract = {Many resources are invested in research training, but very little literature exists on predictors for a successful PhD and postdoctoral training outcome. A PhD program has two overall objectives: to extend knowledge about a hopefully important health topic and to provide extensive training to improve the PhD student's skills through learning research methods and collaboration. A substantial number of PhD students may run into some kind of problem in the course of their PhD program. In this article, some determinants all starting with an "I" and indicative of a good PhD outcome are reported. The successful PhD student can be described as having an Interest in the PhD program, an Incentive for the program, and an Idea of what he or she wants to investigate, showing Initiative, and having high personal Integrity and good Interpersonal relationships. When these so-called I-determinants are present, the likelihood of success in a PhD program is high. More evidence is available for selection of candidates for postdoctoral appointments since it is known that the postdoctoral candidate has completed a PhD program, published papers in peer-reviewed journals, and received awarded grants. However, other characteristics determine a successful transition of the postdoctoral candidate into a research leader. These determinants are Identity, Independence and Image, Implementation ability in terms of being able to implement decisions and projects, working with Innovative and Important topics, having In-depth knowledge of the research topic, being Interactive and Integrated with the scientific community, and Internationally oriented. In conclusion, regardless of the framework of research, the personal characteristics of a researcher play a very important role in the quality of research. Application of some of the principles mentioned in this article might allow decision to reach a more evidence-based way to recruit PhD students and postdoctorals.},

The authors examined the effect of paternal smoking on the risk of pregnancy loss in a prospective cohort of 526 newly married, nonsmoking, female textile workers in China between 1996 and 1998. Upon stopping contraception, subjects provided daily urine specimens and records of vaginal bleeding for up to 1 year or until clinical pregnancy. Daily urinary human chorionic gonadotropin was assayed to detect conception and early pregnancy losses, and pregnancies were followed to detect clinical spontaneous abortions. Subjects were grouped by the number of cigarettes that husbands reported smoking daily: nonsmokers (group 1, n = 216), fewer than 20 cigarettes (group 2, n = 239), and 20 or more cigarettes (group 3, n = 71). Compared with that for group 1, the adjusted odds ratio of early pregnancy loss of any conception for group 2 was 1.04 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.67, 1.63) and for group 3 was 1.81 (95\% CI: 1.00, 3.29). The adjusted hazard ratio of conception for group 2 was 0.90 (95\% CI: 0.70, 1.18) and for group 3 was 0.96 (95\% CI: 0.66, 1.39), while the adjusted hazard ratio of clinical pregnancy for group 2 was 0.93 (95\% CI: 0.72, 1.20) and for group 3 was 0.78 (95\% CI: 0.55, 1.12).

The aim of this study was to investigate risk of early spontaneous abortion related to ETS and active smoking as defined by plasma cotinine levels. METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study in Uppsala County, Sweden, between January 1996 and December 1998. Cases were 463 women with spontaneous abortion at 6 to 12 completed weeks of gestation, and controls were 864 pregnant women matched to cases according to the week of gestation. Exposure status was defined by plasma cotinine concentrations: nonexposed, {\textless}0.1 ng/mL; ETS-exposed, 0.1-15 ng/mL; and exposed to active smoking, {\textgreater}15 ng/mL. Multivariable analysis was used to estimate the relative risk of spontaneous abortion associated with exposure to ETS and active smoking. RESULTS: Nineteen percent of controls and 24\% of cases were classified as having been exposed to ETS. Compared with nonexposed women, risk of spontaneous abortion was increased among both ETS-exposed women (adjusted odds ratio = 1.67; 95\% confidence interval = 1.17-2.38) and active smokers (2.11; 1.36-3.27). We could not show a differential effect of exposure to ETS or active smoking between normal and abnormal fetal karyotype abortions. CONCLUSIONS: Nonsmoking pregnant women exposed to ETS may be at increased risk of spontaneous abortion. Given the high prevalence of ETS exposure, the public health consequences of passive smoking regarding early fetal loss may be substantial.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stress is thought to be abortogenic and psycho-neuro-immunological pathways have been suggested to be involved in triggering miscarriages. From experiments in pregnant mice exposed to stress some insights into the underlying mechanisms have been gained, delineating immunological imbalances as a cause of pregnancy failure. In order to test the validity of the conclusions drawn from murine experiments and the role of stress in human pregnancy loss, the following study was performed. METHODS: We used an established perceived stress questionnaire and measured the stress score of women with a confirmed diagnosis of first trimester spontaneous abortion (n = 94). Decidual tissue was investigated by immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization to detect the presence and distribution of immunocompetent decidual cells [CD56(+) natural killer (NK) cells, CD8(+)and CD3(+) T cells, tryptase(+) mast cells (MCT(+)) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha(+) cells]. The patient cohort was divided into women experiencing low or high levels of stress. RESULTS: In the decidua of women with high stress scores we observed significantly higher numbers of MCT(+), CD8(+) T cells and TNF-alpha(+) cells per mm(2) tissue (P {\textless} or = 0.05). No significant differences between individuals with lower or higher stress scores could be observed with respect to decidual CD56(+) NK and CD3(+) T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Using a questionnaire to score perceived stress in humans may be a valid approach to assess non-biased stress scores. Stress-triggered abortion in humans, identified by a questionnaire, can be linked to immunological imbalances.},

STUDY DESIGN: This was a population-based prospective cohort study. RESULTS: An increasing dose of daily caffeine intake during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, compared with no caffeine intake, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.42 (95\% confidence interval 0.93 to 2.15) for caffeine intake of less than 200 mg/day, and aHR of 2.23 (1.34 to 3.69) for intake of 200 or more mg/day, respectively. Nausea or vomiting during pregnancy did not materially affect this observed association, nor did the change in intake pattern of caffeine during pregnancy. In addition, the magnitude of the association appeared to be stronger among women without a history of miscarriage (aHR 2.33, 1.48 to 3.67) than that among women with such a history (aHR 0.81, 0.34 to 1.94).

METHODS: Maternal serum free beta hCG and PAPP-A were measured at 10-14 weeks of gestation in 5,584 singleton pregnancies. In the 5,297 (94.9\%) pregnancies with complete follow up free beta hCG and PAPP-A were compared between those with normal outcome and those resulting in miscarriage, spontaneous preterm delivery, pregnancy induced hypertension or fetal growth restriction and in those with pre-existing or gestational diabetes. RESULTS: Maternal serum PAPP-A increased and beta hCG decreased with gestation. The multiple of median maternal serum PAPP-A was significantly lower in those pregnancies resulting in miscarriage, pregnancy induced hypertension, growth restriction and in those with pre-existing or gestational diabetes mellitus, but not in those complicated by spontaneous preterm delivery. The level was {\textless} 10th centile of the reference range in about 20\% of the pregnancies that subsequently resulted in miscarriage or developed pregnancy induced hypertension or growth restriction, and in 27\% of those that developed gestational diabetes.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted on 157 women who presented with vaginal bleeding in the fifth to tenth week of gestation. Cox regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors for progression to a complete miscarriage within 16 weeks of gestation. RESULTS: Of the 139 women included for data analysis, 36 (25.9\%) had a miscarriage, mostly within two weeks of presentation. The results of our study showed that women aged {\textgreater}/= 34 years were more likely to miscarry (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.95). Compared to women whose partner was 20-30 years of age, women whose partner was {\textgreater}/= 41 years of age also had a higher likelihood of experiencing a miscarriage (HR = 8.33). However, the presence of nausea (HR = 0.33) and a high stress score (i.e. {\textgreater}/= 17) on the Perceived Stress Scale (HR = 0.49) were associated with a reduced likelihood of miscarriage.

In this article, we present a prospective cohort study of 119 patients presenting with threatened miscarriage from gestation weeks 6 to 10 at a tertiary women's hospital emergency unit in Singapore. Thirty (25.2\%) women had a spontaneous miscarriage. Low progesterone and PIBF levels are similarly predictive of subsequent completed miscarriage. Study results (OR, 95\% CI) showed that higher levels of progesterone (0.91, 95\% CI 0.88-0.94) and PIBF (0.99, 95\% CI 0.98-0.99) were associated with lower risk of miscarriage. Low progesterone level was a very strong predictor of miscarriage risk in our study despite previous concerns about its pulsatile secretion. Low serum progesterone and PIBF levels predicted spontaneous miscarriage among women presenting with threatened miscarriage between gestation weeks 6 to 10. Predictive models to calculate probability of spontaneous miscarriage based on serum progesterone, together with maternal BMI and fetal heart are proposed.},

	abstract = {The renin-angiotensin system is associated with a variety of pathophysiological processes in many organ systems, and is known to be involved in the normal regulation of blood pressure and in the pathogenesis of renovascular hypertension. Angiotensin II is a multifunctional hormone that manifests its properties by interacting with two major subtypes of cell surface receptors (AT1 and AT2). Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are able to modify the actions of the renin-angiotensin system, and are indicated for the treatment of hypertension and heart disease. The antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibiting drugs are related to their ability to block the conversion of the decapeptide, angiotensin I, to the potent pressor octapeptide, angiotensin II. ACE inhibitors have been implicated in fetopathies in humans and perinatal mortality in rats, rabbits, sheep and baboons. Human fetopathies were seen when ACE inhibitors were given around the 26th week of gestation. The major adverse effects in babies include: oligohydramnios, renal tubular dysgenesis, neonatal anuria, calvarial and pulmonary hypoplasia, mild to severe intrauterine growth retardation, persistent patent ductus arteriosus and fetal or neonatal death. These developmental anomalies are thought to be partly due to a direct action of ACE inhibitors on the fetal renin-angiotensin system and partly due to the ischemia resulting from maternal hypotension and decreases in fetal-placental blood flow and oxygen/nutrient delivery to the fetus. The purpose of this review is to briefly discuss the pathophysiological role of the renin-angiotensin system, the therapeutic uses of ACE inhibitors in pregnant patients and to focus primarily on the major fetotoxic effects of ACE inhibitors encountered in humans and animal models. I will also review our recent data which show that capozide (captopril + hydrochlorothiazide) not only produces oligohydramnios but also disturbs the balance of glucose and NaCl in the maternal plasma and amniotic fluid of the rat.},

The objective of this study was to investigate the association between pregnant women with CH and the possible risk of congenital abnormalities (CAs) among their offspring. The prevalence of medically recorded CH in the prenatal maternity logbook was compared between 1030 pregnant women who later had offspring with CA (case group) and 1579 pregnant women with CH who later delivered newborn infants without CA (control group). Control newborn infants were matched to cases in the population-based data set of the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance System of Congenital Abnormalities during 1980-1996. Of 23 different CA groups with informative offspring, esophageal atresia/stenosis was a greater risk in pregnant women with CH (adjusted odds ratios with 95\% confidence intervals: 3.1, 1.4-6.8). In conclusion, a higher risk of esophageal atresia/stenosis was found in the offspring of pregnant women with severe CH, which could not be explained by related drug treatments. This finding requires confirmation or lack thereof by future studies.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent case-control studies and metaanalyses have attempted to quantify the risks associated with individual thrombophilic defects and adverse clinical events in pregnancy, including fetal loss, preeclampsia, placental abruption and intrauterine growth restriction. This review has examined the evidence. RECENT FINDINGS: The literature is in general agreement that thrombophilia increases the risk of venous thromboembolism and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy loss, preeclampsia, placental abruption and intrauterine growth restriction in pregnancy. However, the size of the estimated risks varies between individual studies due to heterogeneity in study design. Low-molecular-weight heparin has been shown to be the superior choice, on the grounds of safety and effectiveness, in preventing venous thromboembolism and improving pregnancy loss. Large-scale, randomized controlled studies are required, however, to confirm these findings. Although selective thrombophilia screening based on prior venous thromboembolism history has been shown to be marginally more cost-effective than universal screening in pregnancy, the overall clinical and economic benefit of universal and selective screening is unsupported. SUMMARY: Despite the growing evidence in the literature, there are still gaps in our knowledge of thrombophilia and pregnancy. In particular, accurate estimates are required of the risks of venous thromboembolism and adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with some thrombophilias and the relative clinical and cost-effectiveness of different anticoagulation therapies in the prevention of venous thromboembolism and pregnancy loss. More large-scale studies are required to better inform clinicians and help determine optimum management and prevention strategies of thrombophilia and associated adverse clinical events in pregnancy.},

Some agents cause either sodium retention or extracellular volume expansion, or activate directly or indirectly the sympathetic nervous system. Other substances act directly on arteriolar smooth muscle or do not have a defined mechanism of action. Some medications that usually lower blood pressure may paradoxically increase blood pressure, or an increase in pressure may be encountered after their discontinuation. In general, drug-induced pressure increases are small and transient: however, severe hypertension involving encephalopathy, stroke, and irreversible renal failure have been reported. The deleterious effect of therapeutic agents is more pronounced in patients with preexisting hypertension, in those with renal failure, and in the elderly. Careful evaluation of a patient's drug regimen may identify chemically induced hypertension and obviate unnecessary evaluation and facilitate antihypertensive therapy. Once chemical-induced hypertension has been identified, discontinuation of the causative agent is recommended, although hypertension can often be managed by specific therapy and dose adjustment if continued use of the offending agent is mandatory.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk in relation to age at menopause, age at menarche, parity, bilateral oophorectomy, and time since menopause, as well as any interaction with randomized hormone therapy (HT) assignment, among postmenopausal women. METHODS: Using pooled data from the Women's Health Initiative HT clinical trials including 27,035 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years who had no history of VTE, we assessed the risk of VTE in relation to age at menopause, age at menarche, parity, bilateral oophorectomy, and time since menopause by Cox proportional hazards models. Linear trends, quadratic relationships, and interactions of reproductive life characteristics with HT on VTE risk were systematically tested. RESULTS: During follow-up, 426 women reported a first VTE, including 294 non-procedure-related events. No apparent interaction of reproductive life characteristics with HT assignment on VTE risk was detected, and there was not a significant association between VTE and age at menarche, age at menopause, parity, oophorectomy, or time since menopause. However, analyses restricted to non-procedure-related VTE showed a U-shaped relationship between age at menopause and thrombotic risk that persisted after multivariable analysis (P {\textless} 0.01). Compared with women aged 40 to 49 years at menopause, those who had early menopause (age {\textless}40 y) or late menopause (age {\textgreater}55 y) had a significantly increased VTE risk (hazard ratio [95\% CI]: 1.8 [1.2-2.7] and 1.5 [1.0-2.4], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Reproductive life characteristics have little association with VTE and do not seem to influence the effect of HT on thrombotic risk among postmenopausal women. Nevertheless, early and late onset of menopause might be newly identified risk factors for non-procedure-related VTE.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In contrast to deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, superficial venous thrombosis has not been considered to be a marker of occult cancer. However, actual data regarding the association are very limited. METHODS: We identified all patients in Denmark from 1994 to 2009 with a diagnosis of superficial venous thrombosis, deep venous thrombosis in the legs or pulmonary embolism using population-based health registries. The occurrence of cancer in the three venous thromboembolism cohorts was compared with the expected numbers of cases estimated using national incidence rates to compute standardised incidence ratios (SIRs). FINDINGS: We identified a total of 7663 patients with superficial venous thrombosis, 45,252 with deep venous thrombosis and 24,332 with pulmonary embolism. In the first year of follow-up, very similar proportions of patients in the three cohorts were diagnosed with cancer. The SIR was 2.46 (95\% CI, 2.10-2.86) for superficial venous thrombosis, 2.75 (95\% CI, 2.60-2.90) for deep venous thrombosis, and 3.27 (95\% CI, 3.03-3.52) for pulmonary embolism. After one year, the SIRs declined to 1.05 (95\% CI, 0.96-1.16), 1.11 (95\% CI 1.07-1.16) and 1.15 (95\% CI, 1.09-1.22), respectively. For all three patient cohorts, particularly strong associations were found for cancers of the liver, lung, ovaries and pancreas as well as for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. INTERPRETATION: Venous thrombosis, whenever it is seen in the lower limbs, is a preclinical marker of prevalent cancer, particularly during the first year after diagnosis.},

METHODS: We conducted a nationwide study of a cohort of patients with deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism that was drawn from the Danish National Registry of Patients for the years 1977 through 1992. The occurrence of cancer in the cohort was determined by linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry. The expected number of cancer cases was estimated on the basis of national age-, sex-, and site-specific incidence rates. RESULTS: A total of 15,348 patients with deep venous thrombosis and 11,305 patients with pulmonary embolism were identified. We observed 1737 cases of cancer in the cohort with deep venous thrombosis, as compared with 1372 expected cases (standardized incidence ratio, 1.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.21 to 1.33). Among the patients with pulmonary embolism, the standardized incidence ratio was 1.3, with a 95 percent confidence interval of 1.22 to 1.41. The risk was substantially elevated only during the first six months of follow-up and declined rapidly thereafter to a constant level slightly above 1.0 one year after the thrombotic event. Forty percent of the patients given a diagnosis of cancer within one year after hospitalization for thromboembolism had distant metastases at the time of the diagnosis of cancer. There were strong associations with several cancers, most pronounced for those of the pancreas, ovary, liver (primary hepatic cancer), and brain.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In contrast to the established relation between overt cancer and subsequent venous thromboembolism, it is unclear whether symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis is associated with a risk of subsequent overt malignant disease. METHODS: Two hundred sixty consecutive patients with symptomatic, venographically proved deep-vein thrombosis were enrolled in a study, of whom 250 were followed during a two-year period. Among those assessed during follow-up, the incidence of subsequently detected cancer in the 105 patients with secondary venous thrombosis (i.e., thrombosis associated with a well-recognized risk factor other than cancer) was compared with the incidence of cancer in the 145 patients with idiopathic venous thrombosis. RESULTS: Routine examination at the time of diagnosis of the venous thrombosis revealed cancer in 5 of the 153 enrolled patients with idiopathic venous thrombosis (3.3 percent) and in none of the 107 enrolled patients with secondary venous thrombosis. During follow-up, overt cancer developed in 2 of the 105 patients with secondary venous thrombosis (1.9 percent) and in 11 of the 145 patients with idiopathic venous thrombosis (7.6 percent; odds ratio, 2.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 5.2; P = 0.043). Of the 145 patients with idiopathic venous thrombosis, 35 had confirmed recurrent thromboembolism. Overt cancer subsequently developed in 6 of the 35 (17.1 percent). The incidence of cancer in the patients with recurrent idiopathic venous thrombosis was higher than that in the patients with secondary venous thrombosis (P = 0.008; odds ratio, 9.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 52.2) or in the patients with idiopathic venous thrombosis that did not recur (P = 0.024; odds ratio, 4.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 15.3).

We used plasmode simulations based on empirical data to discuss and evaluate data-adaptive approaches for variable selection and prediction modeling that can be combined with the high-dimensional propensity score to improve confounding control in large healthcare databases. We considered approaches that combine the high-dimensional propensity score with Super Learner prediction modeling, a scalable version of collaborative targeted maximum-likelihood estimation, and penalized regression. We evaluated performance using bias and mean squared error (MSE) in effect estimates. Results showed that the high-dimensional propensity score can be sensitive to the number of variables included for adjustment and that severe overfitting of the propensity score model can negatively impact the properties of effect estimates. Combining the high-dimensional propensity score with Super Learner was the most consistent strategy, in terms of reducing bias and MSE in the effect estimates, and may be promising for semiautomated data-adaptive propensity score estimation in high-dimensional covariate datasets.},

	abstract = {Contrary to the impression given in some textbooks, matching can reduce the efficiency of a cohort study, even when it produces no sample-size reduction and even if the matching variable is a confounder. The authors illustrate this along with some additional points regarding cohort matching. First, the impact of matching on efficiency can be in opposite directions for different measures of effect; as a consequence, criteria for deciding whether to match must depend on whether one wishes to estimate relative or absolute effects. Second, the commonly drawn analogy between blocking in randomized trials and matching in cohort studies is misleading when one considers the impact of matching on covariate distributions. Third, the conditions for efficiency overmatching in a cohort study are different from the conditions in a case-control study. It appears that, under an additive model, matching will usually increase the efficiency of both risk-difference and risk-ratio estimation, and the power of the Mantel-Haenszel test. Under a multiplicative model, the impact of matching is not as consistently beneficial. The authors present some approximate criteria which allow one to use a priori information to predict whether cohort matching is likely to improve efficiency.},

For this purpose, a systematic review of published case reports and case series dealing with intrauterine exposure to ACE-Is or to ARBs using Medline as the source of data was performed. The publications retained for analysis included patients who were described individually, revealing, at minimum, the gestational age, substance used, period of medication intake, and the outcome. In total, 72 reports were included; 37 articles (118 well-documented cases) described the prenatal exposure to ACE-Is; and 35 articles (68 cases) described the prenatal exposure to ARBs. Overall, 52\% of the newborns exposed to ACE-Is and 13\% of the newborns exposed to ARBs did not exhibit any complications (P{\textless}0.0001). Neonatal complications were more frequent following exposure to ARBs and included renal failure, oligohydramnios, death, arterial hypotension, intrauterine growth retardation, respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary hypoplasia, hypocalvaria, limb defects, persistent patent ductus arteriosus, or cerebral complications. The long-term outcome is described as positive in only 50\% of the exposed children. Fetopathy caused by exposure to ACE-Is or ARBs has relevant neonatal and long-term complications. The outcome is poorer following exposure to ARBs. We propose the term "fetal renin-angiotensin system blockade syndrome" to describe the related clinical findings. Thirty years after the first description of ACE-I fetopathy, relevant complications are, at present, regularly described, indicating that the awareness of the deleterious effect of prenatal exposure to drugs inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system should be improved.},

Logistic regression analysis was used to determine which of the maternal characteristics and history had significant contribution in predicting early-PE, late-PE and GH. There were 37 cases with early-PE, 128 with late-PE, 140 with GH and 8061 cases that were unaffected by PE or GH. Predictors of early-PE were Black race, chronic hypertension, prior PE and use of ovulation drugs. Predictors of late-PE and GH were increased maternal age and body mass index, and family history or history of PE. Additionally, late-PE was more common in Black, Indian and Pakistani women. The detection rates of early-PE, late-PE and GH in screening by maternal factors were 37.0, 28.9 and 20.7\%, respectively, for a 5\% false positive rate. Screening as suggested by NICE would have resulted in a false positive rate of 64.1\% with detection rates of 89.2, 93.0 and 85.0\% for early-PE, late-PE and GH, respectively.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and unexplained intrauterine growth restriction may have similar determinants and consequences. In this study, we compared determinants and perinatal outcomes associated with these obstetric conditions. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed 39,615 pregnancies (data from the WHO Antenatal Care Trial), of which 2.2\% were complicated by preeclampsia, 7.0\% by gestational hypertension, and 8.1\% by unexplained intrauterine growth restriction (ie, not associated with maternal smoking, maternal undernutrition, preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, or congenital malformations). We compared the risk factors associated with these groups. Fetal death, preterm delivery, and severe neonatal morbidity and mortality were the primary outcomes. Logistic regression analyses were adjusted for study site, socioeconomic status, and (if appropriate) birth weight and gestational age. RESULTS: Diabetes, renal or cardiac disease, previous preeclampsia, urinary tract infection, high maternal age, twin pregnancy, and obesity increased the risk of both hypertensive conditions. Previous large-for-age birth, reproductive tract surgery, antepartum hemorrhage and reproductive tract infection increased the risk for gestational hypertension only. Independent of maternal age, primiparity was a risk factor only for preeclampsia. Both preeclampsia and gestational hypertension were associated with increased risk for fetal death and severe neonatal morbidity and mortality. Mothers with preeclampsia compared with those with unexplained intrauterine growth restriction were more likely to have a history of diabetes, renal or cardiac disease, chronic hypertension, previous preeclampsia, body mass index more than 30 kg/cm2, urinary tract infection and extremes of maternal age. Conversely, unexplained intrauterine growth restriction was associated with higher risk of low birth weight in previous pregnancies, but not with previous preeclampsia. Both conditions increased the risk for perinatal outcomes independently but preeclampsia was associated with considerable higher risk. CONCLUSION: Preeclampsia and gestational hypertension shared many risk factors, although there are differences that need further evaluation. Both conditions significantly increased morbidity and mortality. Conversely, preeclampsia and unexplained intrauterine growth restriction, often assumed to be related to placental insufficiency, seem to be independent biologic entities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia (PE), especially severe or early PE, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among mothers and infants. We estimated the population attributable fractions of severe or early PE associated with pre-existing conditions among nulliparous and multiparous women. METHODS: Among 70 924 women in the Danish National Birth Cohort, we used hospital discharge data to identify 2117 cases of PE, of which 449 were early ({\textless}37 weeks), 426 were severe (clinically diagnosed) and 228 were both early and severe. Prospective interview data were supplemented with hospital registry data to identify women with pre-existing conditions. Generalized estimating equations were utilized to estimate adjusted relative risks, and population attributable fractions were calculated with 95\% CI. RESULTS: Pre-existing hypertension, diabetes, obesity or multiple gestation were associated with 22.3\% (19.8-24.9) of all PE cases among nulliparous women. These conditions, or a prior preeclamptic pregnancy, were associated with 52.2\% (46.4-57.9) of PE among multiparous women. Early PE was preceded by these pre-existing conditions among 34\% (28.3-40.0) of affected nulliparous women and among 50\% (37.5-63.4) of multiparous women. The fraction of severe PE associated with these conditions was 23\% among nulliparas and 59\% among multiparas. Being obese or overweight was associated with 15-17\% of the population risk of early PE among nulliparous and multiparous women. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-existing maternal and obstetric conditions are associated with a high proportion of severe or early cases of PE. Obesity and overweight contributed independently to the risk of pre-term PE, a finding with potentially profound public health implications.},

DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the World Health Organization Multicountry Survey on Maternal and Newborn Health (WHOMCS) database. SETTING: Cross-sectional study implemented at 357 health facilities conducting 1000 or more deliveries annually in 29 countries from Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. POPULATION: All women suffering from any hypertensive disorder during pregnancy, the intrapartum or early postpartum period in the participating hospitals during the study period. METHODS: We calculated the proportion of the pre-specified outcomes in the study population and their distribution according to hypertensive disorders' severity. We estimated the association between them and maternal deaths, near-miss cases, and severe maternal complications using a multilevel logit model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Potentially life-threatening conditions among maternal near-miss cases, maternal deaths and cases without severe maternal outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 8542 (2.73\%) women suffered from hypertensive disorders. Incidences of pre-eclampsia, eclampsia and chronic hypertension were 2.16\%, 0.28\% and 0.29\%, respectively. Maternal near-miss cases were eight times more frequent in women with pre-eclampsia, and increased to up to 60 times more frequent in women with eclampsia, when compared with women without these conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of this large database provides estimates of the global distribution of the incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.

Stratified analyses, using the Mantel-Haenszel technique, and a multiple logistic regression model were performed to control for confounders. RESULTS: Chronic hypertension complicated 1.6\% (n=1807) of all deliveries included in the study (n=113156). Using a multivariable analysis, the following factors were found to be independently associated with chronic hypertension: maternal age {\textgreater}40 years (OR=3.1; 95\% CI 2.7-3.6), diabetes mellitus (OR=3.6; 95\% CI 3.3-4.1), recurrent abortions (OR=1.5; 95\% CI 1.3-1.8), infertility treatment (OR=2.9; 95\% CI 2.3-3.7), and previous cesarean delivery (CD; OR=1.8 CI 1.6-2.0).

METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in four groups of pregnant women at high risk for preeclampsia, including 471 women with pregestational insulin-treated diabetes mellitus, 774 women with chronic hypertension, 688 women with multifetal gestations, and 606 women who had had preeclampsia during a previous pregnancy. The women were enrolled between gestational weeks 13 and 26 and received either 60 mg of aspirin or placebo daily. RESULTS: Outcome data were obtained on all but 36 of the 2539 women who entered the study. The incidence of preeclampsia was similar in the 1254 women in the aspirin group and the 1249 women in the placebo group (aspirin, 18 percent; placebo, 20 percent; P=0.23). The incidences in the aspirin and placebo groups for each of the four high-risk categories were also similar: for women with pregestational diabetes mellitus, the incidence was 18 percent in the aspirin group and 22 percent in the placebo group (P=0.38); for women with chronic hypertension, 26 percent and 25 percent (P= 0.66); for those with multifetal gestations, 12 percent and 16 percent (P=0.10); and for those with preeclampsia during a previous pregnancy, 17 percent and 19 percent (P=0.47). In addition, the incidences of perinatal death, preterm birth, and infants small for gestational age were similar in the aspirin and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, low-dose aspirin did not reduce the incidence of preeclampsia significantly or improve perinatal outcomes in pregnant women at high risk for preeclampsia.},

The corresponding percentages for women with a first pregnancy in their 40s were 32\% and 11\%, respectively. In the year after delivery, women with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy had 12-fold to 25-fold higher rates of hypertension than did women with a normotensive pregnancy. Rates in women with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy were threefold to 10-fold higher 1-10 years post partum and remained twice as high even 20 or more years later.Conclusions The risk of hypertension associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is high immediately after an affected pregnancy and persists for more than 20 years. Up to one third of women with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy may develop hypertension within a decade of an affected pregnancy, indicating that cardiovascular disease prevention in these women should include blood pressure monitoring initiated soon after pregnancy.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect of low-dose aspirin started in early pregnancy on the incidence of preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). DATA SOURCES: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed through electronic database searches (PubMed, Cochrane, Embase). METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials of pregnant women at risk of preeclampsia who were assigned to receive aspirin or placebo (or no treatment) were reviewed. Secondary outcomes included IUGR, severe preeclampsia and preterm birth. The effect of aspirin was analyzed as a function of gestational age at initiation of the intervention (16 weeks of gestation or less, 16 weeks of gestation or more). TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Thirty-four randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, including 27 studies (11,348 women) with follow-up for the outcome of preeclampsia. Low-dose aspirin started at 16 weeks or earlier was associated with a significant reduction in preeclampsia (relative risk [RR] 0.47, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.34-0.65, prevalence in 9.3\% treated compared with 21.3\% control) and IUGR (RR 0.44, 95\% CI 0.30-0.65, 7\% treated compared with 16.3\% control), whereas aspirin started after 16 weeks was not (preeclampsia: RR 0.81, 95\% CI 0.63-1.03, prevalence in 7.3\% treated compared with 8.1\% control; IUGR: RR 0.98, 95\% CI 0.87-1.10, 10.3\% treated compared with 10.5\% control). Low-dose aspirin started at 16 weeks or earlier also was associated with a reduction in severe preeclampsia (RR 0.09, 95\% CI 0.02-0.37, 0.7\% treated compared with 15.0\% control), gestational hypertension (RR 0.62, 95\% CI 0.45-0.84, 16.7\% treated compared with 29.7\% control), and preterm birth (RR 0.22, 95\% CI 0.10-0.49, 3.5\% treated compared with 16.9\% control). Of note, all studies for which aspirin had been started at 16 weeks or earlier included women identified to be at moderate or high risk for preeclampsia. CONCLUSION: Low-dose aspirin initiated in early pregnancy is an efficient method of reducing the incidence of preeclampsia and IUGR.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine a reported association between use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors during the first trimester and risk of malformations in offspring. DESIGN: A population based, retrospective cohort study linking automated clinical and pharmacy databases including comprehensive electronic medical records. PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women and their live born offspring (465,754 mother-infant pairs) in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California region from 1995 to 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Congenital malformation in live births. RESULTS: The prevalence of ACE inhibitor use in the first trimester only was 0.9/1000, and the use of other antihypertensive medications was 2.4/1000. After adjustment for maternal age, ethnicity, parity, and obesity, use of ACE inhibitors during the first trimester only seemed to be associated with increased risk of congenital heart defects in offspring compared with normal controls (those with neither hypertension nor use of any antihypertensives during pregnancy) (15/381 (3.9\%) v 6232/400,021 (1.6\%) cases, odds ratio 1.54 (95\% confidence interval 0.90 to 2.62)). A similar association was observed for use of other antihypertensives (28/1090 (2.6\%) cases of congenital heart defects, odds ratio 1.52 (1.04 to 2.21)). However, compared with hypertension controls (those with a diagnosis of hypertension but without use of antihypertensives) (708/29,735 (2.4\%) cases of congenital heart defects), neither use of ACE inhibitors or of other antihypertensives in the first trimester was associated with increased congenital heart defects risk (odds ratios 1.14 (0.65 to 1.98) and 1.12 (0.76 to 1.64) respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal use of ACE inhibitors in the first trimester has a risk profile similar to the use of other antihypertensives regarding malformations in live born offspring. The apparent increased risk of malformations associated with use of ACE inhibitors (and other antihypertensives) in the first trimester is likely due to the underlying hypertension rather than the medications.},

Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, especially preeclampsia, are a leading cause of maternal death worldwide and even in developed countries increase perinatal mortality rates 5-fold. Much has been learned about preeclampsia, but gaps in the knowledge necessary to direct therapeutic strategies remain. Oxidative stress is a biologically plausible contributor to the disorder that may be amenable to intervention. Hypertension that antedates pregnancy (chronic hypertension) bears many similarities to hypertension in nonpregnant women, but the special setting of pregnancy demands information to guide evidence-based therapy. The recommendations of the Working Group are to attempt a clinical trial of antioxidant therapy to prevent preeclampsia that is be complemented by mechanistic research to increase understanding of the genetics and pathogenesis of the disorder. For chronic hypertension, clinical trials are recommended to direct choice of drugs, evaluate degree of control, and assess implications to the mother and fetus. Recommendations to increase participation in this research are also presented.},

METHODS: Eligible women were randomly assigned treatment with slow-release nifedipine, 10 mg twice daily until delivery, or no treatment. In the no treatment group nifedipine was given if the diastolic pressure exceeded 110 mmHg. A total of 145 women were assigned nifedipine and 138 no treatment. RESULTS: In the nifedipine group 45.0\% of women were delivered before term, compared with 37.0\% in the no treatment group; the difference was not significant. In all, 56.3\% of women allocated nifedipine and 62.1\% allocated no treatment underwent caesarean section; the difference was not statistically different (OR 0.7, 95\% CI 0.4-1.1).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antihypertensives, such as beta-blockers, are used for pregnancy hypertension in the belief these will improve outcome for mother and baby. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether oral beta-blockers are better than placebo, or no beta-blocker, and have advantages over other antihypertensives, for women with mild to moderate pregnancy hypertension. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (May 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2002), bibliographies of retrieved papers and personal files. SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials comparing beta-blockers with placebo or no therapy, or other antihypertensives, for women with mild to moderate pregnancy hypertension. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted the data independently and were not blinded to trial characteristics or outcomes. Whenever possible, we contacted authors for missing data. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-nine trials (approximately 2500 women) are included. Thirteen trials (1480 women) compared beta-blockers with placebo/no beta blocker. Oral beta-blockers decrease the risk of severe hypertension (relative risk (RR) 0.37, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.53; 11 trials, N = 1128 women) and the need for additional antihypertensives (RR 0.44, 95\% CI 0.31 to 0.62; 7 trials, N = 856 women). There are insufficient data for conclusions about the effect on perinatal mortality or preterm birth. Beta-blockers seem to be associated with an increase in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants (RR 1.36, 95\% CI 1.02 to 1.82; 12 trials; N = 1346 women). Maternal hospital admission may be decreased, neonatal bradycardia increased and respiratory distress syndrome decreased, but these outcomes are reported in only a small proportion of trials. In 13 trials (854 women), beta-blockers were compared with methyldopa. Beta-blockers appear to be no more effective and probably equally as safe. Single small trials have compared beta-blockers with hydralazine, nicardipine or isradipine. It is unusual for women to change drugs due to side effects. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in control of maternal blood pressure with use of beta-blockers would be worthwhile only if it were reflected in substantive benefits for mother and/or baby, and none have been clearly demonstrated. The effect of beta-blockers on perinatal outcome is uncertain; the worrying trend to an increase in SGA infants is partly dependent on one small outlying trial. Large randomised trials are needed to determine whether antihypertensive therapy in general (rather than beta-blocker therapy specifically) results in greater benefit than risk, for treatment of mild-moderate pregnancy hypertension. If so, then it would be appropriate to consider which antihypertensive is best, and beta-blockers should be evaluated.},

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study of Doppler ultrasonographic blood flow data before and after 1 week of methyldopa treatment was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National University Hospital, Singapore, in 20 women (mean 35 weeks' gestation) with pregnancy-induced hypertension. The main outcome measures were maternal blood pressure, maternal and fetal heart rate, and blood velocity waveforms characterized by the pulsatility index in the fetal ascending aorta, middle cerebral artery, umbilical artery, and maternal uterine and arcuate arteries. Statistical evaluation was performed with t tests for paired observations. RESULTS: Maternal mean arterial blood pressure was reduced 9.7 mm Hg (95\% confidence interval -13.8 to -5.6), and mean heart rate decreased 6.3 beats/min (95\% confidence interval -11.1 to -1.4). Mean pulsatility index in the uterine (0.93 to 0.92) and arcuate arteries (0.61 to 0.73) were unchanged after treatment. Fetal hemodynamic changes before and after treatment were not significant.

METHODS: The study design was a metaregression analysis of published data from randomised controlled trials. Data from a paper that was regarded as an extreme statistical outliner were excluded from primary analyses. The change in (group) mean arterial pressure (MAP) from enrolment to delivery was compared with indicators of fetoplacental growth. FINDINGS: Greater mean difference in MAP with antihypertensive therapy was associated with the birth of a higher proportion of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants (slope: 0.09 [SD 0.03], r2=0.48, p=0.006, 14 trials) and lower mean birthweight significant after exclusion of data from another paper regarded as an extreme statistical outliner (slope: -14.49 [6.98] r=0.16, p=0.049, 27). No relation with mean placental weight was seen (slope -2.01 [1.62], r2=0.15, p=0.25, 11 trials). INTERPRETATION: Treatment-induced falls in maternal blood pressure may adversely affect fetal growth. Given the small maternal benefits that are likely to be derived from therapy, new data are urgently needed to elucidate the relative maternal and fetal benefits and risks of oral antihypertensive drug treatment of mild-to-moderate pregnancy hypertension.},

However, there were no differences among the three groups regarding the incidences of either superimposed preeclampsia (15.6\%, 18.4\%, and 16.3\%, respectively), abruptio placentae (2.2\%, 1.1\%, and 2.3\%, respectively), or preterm delivery (10\%, 12.5\%, and 11.6\%, respectively). In addition, there were no differences among the groups regarding gestational age at delivery, birth weight, incidence of fetal growth retardation, or neonatal head circumference. There was one midtrimester loss in the methyldopa group and one stillbirth in each of the other groups. We conclude that treatment of maternal blood pressure in mild chronic hypertension during pregnancy did not improve perinatal outcome.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of atenolol on the outcome of pregnancy in women with essential hypertension. DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study. SETTING: Hospital clinic. PATIENTS: 33 Women with mild essential hypertension (systolic blood pressure 140-170 mm Hg or diastolic pressure 90-110 mm Hg on two occasions at least 24 hours apart) consecutively referred to two obstetric medical clinics. Four patients in the placebo group were withdrawn from the study: control of blood pressure was inadequate in two, one developed breathlessness, and one changed her mind about participating. The mean gestation in the 29 remaining women on entry to the study was 15.9 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood pressure and birth weight. INTERVENTION: 14 Women received placebo. 15 Women received atenolol 50 mg daily initially, increasing until either the blood pressure was less than 140/90 mm Hg or a dose of 200 micrograms daily was reached. RESULTS: The mean blood pressure on entry was 148/86 mm Hg in the group given atenolol and 144/86 mm Hg in the group given placebo. During treatment the mean diastolic pressure was significantly reduced by atenolol compared with placebo (to 74 v 81 mm Hg; difference in means (95\% confidence interval) 7.0 (2.9 to 10.0) mm Hg) but the effect on systolic pressure was marginal (132 v 136 mm Hg; 4.0 (-1.4 to 8.6) mm Hg). Babies in the atenolol group had a significantly lower birth weight than those in the placebo group (2620 g v 3530 g; 910 (440 to 1380)g). CONCLUSION: Atenolol given from the end of the first trimester in patients with mild hypertension is associated with intrauterine growth retardation. When taken in conjunction with the results of a previous study in which methyldopa was given these findings indicate that benefit is unlikely to result from treating mild essential hypertension in pregnancy.},

Methyldopa-treated patients registering in the first trimester had a significant reduction in the mean arterial pressure (MAP) during the second and third trimesters (P less than 0.025). No significant differences in birth weight (BW), ponderal index (PI) were found when results were corrected for gestational age (GA), race, and sex. The mean GA was significantly prolonged in the methyldopa-treated group by 10.3 days (P less than 0.05). The frequency of superimposed pre-eclampsia was similar in both groups (33.3\% vs. 38.4\%). However, 75\% of the superimposed pre-eclampsia occurred antepartum in the placebo group, while 80\% of the methyldopa-treated group developed superimposed pre-eclampsia intrapartum.

Twenty patients were in their first trimester and were receiving diuretics at time of entry to the study: Ten patients were allowed to continue their diuretic medication throughout pregnancy (diuretic group), whereas for the other 10 patients, diuretics were discontinued immediately. Plasma volume was serially measured throughout pregnancy with the use of the Evans blue dye-dilution technique. Initial plasma volume was similar in the two groups. However, in the diuretic group, subsequent plasma volume findings at various stages of gestation were markedly reduced when compared to respective plasma volume findings in the other group. In addition, plasma volume expansion was minimal in the diuretic group (mean increase of 18\%), whereas it was normal in the other group (mean increase of 52\%). Two patients in the diuretic group and one patient in the other group required other antihypertensive medication. There was no difference in perinatal outcome between the two groups.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of evidence relating to management of mild chronic hypertension during pregnancy, including associated risks, benefits, and harms of treatment with antihypertensive agents, nonpharmacologic measures, and aspirin and benefits of various monitoring strategies. DATA SOURCES: Using four broad search strategies, we searched English and non-English-language citations in 16 electronic databases from their inception to February 1999 and consulted relevant textbooks, references, and experts. STUDY SELECTION: Reviewers screened 6228 abstracts and found 215 articles that met multiple prespecified patient selection, study population, and design criteria. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Forty-six studies consistently showed that chronic hypertension triples the risk for perinatal mortality (odds ratio [OR] 3.4; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 3.0, 3.7) and doubles the risk for placental abruption (OR 2.1; 95\% CI 1.1, 3.9). Thirteen small, randomized controlled trials had inadequate power to rule in or rule out moderate-to-large (20\%-50\%) benefits of antihypertensive treatment. Possible adverse effects were fetal renal failure when angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are used in the second or third trimester and growth restriction when atenolol is used early in pregnancy. Trials showed that aspirin neither reduces nor increases perinatal and maternal morbidity, but they did not rule out possible small-to moderate beneficial or adverse effects. No studies provide guidance on benefits or consequences of various nonpharmacologic therapies or monitoring strategies. CONCLUSION: Mild chronic hypertension is associated with increased maternal and fetal risks. Beneficial treatment and monitoring regimens are not clear, but some treatments, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, are best avoided.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Very high blood pressure during pregnancy poses a serious threat to women and their babies. The aim of antihypertensive therapy is to lower blood pressure quickly but safety, to avoid complications. Antihypertensive drugs lower blood pressure but their comparative effectiveness and safety, and impact on other substantive outcomes is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To compare different antihypertensive drugs for very high blood pressure during pregnancy. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (9 January 2013). SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies were randomised trials. Participants were women with severe hypertension during pregnancy. Interventions were comparisons of one antihypertensive drug with another. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed trial quality. Two review authors extracted data and checked them for accuracy. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-five trials (3573 women) with 15 comparisons were included. Women allocated calcium channel blockers were less likely to have persistent high blood pressure compared to those allocated hydralazine (six trials, 313 women; 8\% versus 22\%; risk ratio (RR) 0.37, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.66). Ketanserin was associated with more persistent high blood pressure than hydralazine (three trials, 180 women; 27\% versus 6\%; RR 4.79, 95\% CI 1.95 to 11.73), but fewer side-effects (three trials, 120 women; RR 0.32, 95\% CI 0.19 to 0.53) and a lower risk of HELLP (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and lowered platelets) syndrome (one trial, 44 women; RR 0.20, 95\% CI 0.05 to 0.81).Labetalol was associated with a lower risk of hypotension compared to diazoxide (one trial 90 women; RR 0.06, 95\% CI 0.00 to 0.99) and a lower risk of caesarean section (RR 0.43, 95\% CI 0.18 to 1.02), although both were borderline for statistical significance.Both nimodipine and magnesium sulphate were associated with a high incidence of persistent high blood pressure, but this risk was lower for nimodipine compared to magnesium sulphate (one trial, 1650 women; 47\% versus 65\%; RR 0.84, 95\% CI 0.76 to 0.93). Nimodipine was associated with a lower risk of respiratory difficulties (RR 0.28, 95\% CI 0.08 to 0.99), fewer side-effects (RR 0.68, 95\% CI 0.55 to 0.85) and less postpartum haemorrhage (RR 0.41, 95\% CI 0.18 to 0.92) than magnesium sulphate. Stillbirths and neonatal deaths were not reported.There are insufficient data for reliable conclusions about the comparative effects of any other drugs. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Until better evidence is available the choice of antihypertensive should depend on the clinician's experience and familiarity with a particular drug; on what is known about adverse effects; and on women's preferences. Exceptions are nimodipine, magnesium sulphate (although this is indicated for women who require an anticonvulsant for prevention or treatment of eclampsia), diazoxide and ketanserin, which are probably best avoided.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) is becoming increasingly common. However, a recent study based on a series of cases reported to FDA suggests possible teratogenic effects of statins on embryogenesis, such as limb defects and severe central nervous system anomalies. METHODS: In a prospective, observational cohort study with a comparison group to examine a fetal toxicity risk of statins, we followed 64 pregnant women taking statins, and 64 comparison group women without exposure to known teratogens. The statin group women were exposed to atorvastatin (n=46), simvastatin (n=9), pravastatin (n=6), or rosuvastatin (n=3) during the first trimester. RESULTS: There was no difference in the rate of major malformations between the statin group (1/46 live birth: 2.2\%) and the comparison group (1/52 live birth: 1.9\%, p=0.93). Similarly, there were no statistical differences between the statin and comparison groups in live births (71.9\% vs 81.2\%), spontaneous abortions (14: 21.9\% vs 11: 17.2\%), therapeutic abortions (3: 4.7\% vs 0: 0\%) and stillbirths (1: 1.5\% vs 1: 1.6\%). Gestational age at birth (38.4+/-2.8 weeks vs 39.3+/-1.3 weeks: M+/-S.D., p=0.04) and birth weight (3.14+/-0.68kg vs 3.45+/-0.42kg, p=0.01) were lower in the statin group. CONCLUSIONS: The absolute risk of teratogenicity of statins, if any, appears relatively small. A large-scale study is needed to further characterize the teratogenic potential.},

METHODS: We enrolled women from three sites before 15 weeks of gestation. Demographic and clinical risk factors were collected through standardized chart review. The main outcome of preeclampsia was diagnosed using the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists definitions from 2002. Multivariable logistic regression was used to control for confounders. RESULTS: Two thousand six hundred thirty-seven women are included in this analysis; 237 (9.0\%) developed preeclampsia. In adjusted analysis, chronic hypertension (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.72; 95\% confidence interval 1.78-4.13), pregestational diabetes (adjusted OR 3.88; 2.08-7.26), multiple gestation (adjusted OR 2.96; 1.74-5.03), African American race (adjusted OR 1.91; 1.35-2.71), prior preeclampsia (adjusted OR 3.63; 2.29-5.73), nulliparity (adjusted OR 1.73; 1.26-2.38), assisted reproductive techniques (adjusted OR: 1.72; 1.10-2.68), and being overweight (adjusted OR for body mass index [BMI, kg/m] greater than 25-30: 1.65; 1.13-2.41) or obese (adjusted OR for BMI greater than 30-35: 2.34, 1.51-3.61; adjusted OR for BMI greater than 35-40: 3.59, 2.13-6.03; adjusted OR for BMI greater than 40: 6.04, 3.56-10.24) were associated with preeclampsia, but advanced maternal age was not. Similar associations were found for severe preeclampsia. A dose-response effect was observed in the relationship between BMI and both preeclampsia and severe preeclampsia. Being overweight or obese was the most important risk factor for both preeclampsia and severe preeclampsia with an attributable risk percent of 64.9\% and 64.4\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this contemporary cohort, increasingly prevalent and potentially modifiable factors were confirmed as significant risk factors for preeclampsia and severe preeclampsia, the most important being overweight or obese.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We examined if prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, preterm labor, and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants with consideration of gestational weight gain, to document the importance of preconception versus prenatal stage. METHODS: We used the data of 219 868 women from 2004 to 2011 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the effect of prepregnancy BMI for gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, preterm labor, and SGA and LGA infants with consideration of gestational weight gain. RESULTS: Regardless of gestational weight gain, women with obese prepregnancy BMI ({\textgreater}/=30 kg/m(2)) had increased odds of gestational hypertension (adjusted odds ratios (AOR) = 2.91; 95\% CI = 2.76-3.07), gestational diabetes (2.78; 2.60-2.96), and LGA (1.87; 1.76-1.99) compared to women with normal prepregnancy BMI (18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)). Women with underweight prepregnancy BMI ({\textless}18.5 kg/m(2)) had increased odds of preterm labor (1.25; 1.16-1.36) and SGA infants (1.36; 1.25-1.49), but decreased odds of LGA infants (0.72; 0.61-0.85) in reference to women with normal prepregnancy BMI (18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)). CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of adequacy of gestational weight gain, the risk of gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, and LGA infants increases with obese prepregnancy BMI, whereas that of preterm labor and SGA infants increases with underweight prepregnancy BMI. Preconception care of reproductive aged women is as important as prenatal care to lower the risk of gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, preterm labor, and SGA and LGA infants.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare the risk factors for gestational hypertension (GH) and preeclampsia (PE) in the same population, which may provide clues to better understanding of their etiologic mechanisms. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study in Liuyang, China, during 2010-2011. Twelve potential risk factors were investigated, including maternal age, body mass index at first antenatal visit, gender of newborn, parity, abortion history, smoking history, family history of hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, pregnancy complications of diabetes mellitus/renal disease/cardiac disease, reproductive tract infection, season of delivery, and district level average per capita income. Logistic regression were used to estimate odds ratios for potential risk factors. RESULTS: Of 6223 pregnancies, 1.8\% was complicated by PE, and 5.4\% by GH. Maternal age older than 35, body mass index above 24, and pregnancy complicated with gestational diabetes mellitus increased the risk of both PE and GH, while with different effect sizes. Primiparity and deliver in winter and spring (compared with summer delivery) were risk factors for GH only. Pregnancy complicated with diabetes mellitus/renal disease/cardiac disease was risk factor for PE only. Significantly lower risk of GH was observed for women younger than 25 or with low body mass index in the first trimester. Mothers carrying a male fetus were more likely to develop PE. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for GH and PE were not exactly the same. Underling those differences might be their different etiology and mechanism. To confirm the similarities and differences been found in single study, it is important to conduct investigation in other population.},

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Embase databases, 2000-15. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Cohort studies with {\textgreater}/= 1000 participants that evaluated the risk of pre-eclampsia in relation to a common and generally accepted clinical risk factor assessed at {\textless}/= 16 weeks' gestation. DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent reviewers extracted data from included studies. A pooled event rate and pooled relative risk for pre-eclampsia were calculated for each of 14 risk factors. RESULTS: There were 25,356,688 pregnancies among 92 studies. The pooled relative risk for each risk factor significantly exceeded 1.0, except for prior intrauterine growth restriction. Women with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome had the highest pooled rate of pre-eclampsia (17.3\%, 95\% confidence interval 6.8\% to 31.4\%). Those with prior pre-eclampsia had the greatest pooled relative risk (8.4, 7.1 to 9.9). Chronic hypertension ranked second, both in terms of its pooled rate (16.0\%, 12.6\% to 19.7\%) and pooled relative risk (5.1, 4.0 to 6.5) of pre-eclampsia. Pregestational diabetes (pooled rate 11.0\%, 8.4\% to 13.8\%; pooled relative risk 3.7, 3.1 to 4.3), prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) {\textgreater}30 (7.1\%, 6.1\% to 8.2\%; 2.8, 2.6 to 3.1), and use of assisted reproductive technology (6.2\%, 4.7\% to 7.9\%; 1.8, 1.6 to 2.1) were other prominent risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: There are several practical clinical risk factors that, either alone or in combination, might identify women in early pregnancy who are at "high risk" of pre-eclampsia. These data can inform the generation of a clinical prediction model for pre-eclampsia and the use of aspirin prophylaxis in pregnancy.},

Female participants in community-based Cohort Norway health surveys, 1994 to 2003, were prospectively followed through 2012 via record linkages to Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Analyses included 13 217 singleton pregnancies (average of 1.59 births to 8321 women) without preexisting hypertension. Outcomes were gestational hypertension without proteinuria (n=237) and preeclampsia (n=429). Mean age (SD) at baseline was 27.9 years (4.5), and median follow-up was 4.8 years (interquartile range 2.6-7.8). Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia shared several baseline risk factors: family history of diabetes mellitus, pregravid diabetes mellitus, a high total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio ({\textgreater}5), overweight and obesity, and elevated blood pressure status. For preeclampsia, a family history of myocardial infarction before 60 years of age and elevated triglyceride levels ({\textgreater}/=1.7 mmol/L) also predicted risk while physical activity was protective. Preterm preeclampsia was predicted by past-year binge drinking ({\textgreater}/=5 drinks on one occasion) with an adjusted odds ratio of 3.7 (95\% confidence interval 1.3-10.8) and by past-year physical activity of {\textgreater}/=3 hours per week with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.5 (95\% confidence interval 0.3-0.8).

AIM: To question current definition of high PE risk and propose a definition that considers individual heterogeneity to improves risk classification. METHODS: A stratified analysis by parity was conducted using the Swedish Birth Register between 2002-2010 including 626.600 pregnancies. The discriminatory accuracy (DA) of traditional definitions of high-risk women was compared with a new definition based on 1) specific combinations of individual variables and 2) a centile cut-off of the probability of PE predicted by a multiple logistic regression model. RESULTS: None of the classical risk-factors alone reached an acceptable DA. In multiparous, any combination of a risk-factor with previous PE or HBP reached a +LR{\textgreater}10. The combination of obesity and multiple pregnancy reached a good DA particularly in the presence of previous preeclampsia (positive likelihood ratio (LR+) = 26.5 or chronic hypertension (HBP) LR+ = 40.5. In primiparous, a LR+{\textgreater}15 was observed in multiple pregnancies with the simultaneous presence of obesity and diabetes mellitus or with HBP. Predicted probabilities above 97 centile in multiparous and 99 centile in primiparous provided high (LR+ = 12.5), and moderate (LR+ = 5.85), respectively. No one risk factor alone or in combination provided a LR- sufficiently low to rule-out the disease. CONCLUSIONS: In preeclampsia prediction the combination of specific risk factors provided a better discriminatory accuracy than traditional single risk approach. Our results contribute to a more personalized risk estimation of preeclampsia.},

The evidence to date, however, is conflicting and observed malformations may be due to confounders such as undiagnosed diabetes or maternal obesity, other antihypertensive medications or the hypertension itself. Nonetheless, in women who become pregnant while taking an ACEI or ARB, the drug should be stopped as soon as possible. In women with chronic kidney disease and proteinuria, it may be appropriate to continue taking an ACEI or ARB until the pregnancy is confirmed because of the significant benefit to their kidney function and the lower fertility rate in these patients.},

This study aimed to identify the proportion of women of childbearing age taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs on referral to a tertiary Hypertension Clinic. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: A cohort of female patients aged 16-45 years was identified from approximately 1500 new referrals from January 2004 to October 2006, excluding those not taking antihypertensive medication. ACE inhibitors and ARBs were grouped together for the purposes of the study. Contraceptive status was established where possible. RESULTS: Forty seven of 101 (47\%) women aged 16-45 years were taking an ACE inhibitor (35) an ARB (11) or both (1) of whom 26 (55\%) were aged 16-40 years. In this younger group, eight were using no contraception and three were using barrier methods only. CONCLUSIONS: Many GPs continue to prescribe ACE inhibitors and ARBs to women of childbearing age. A quarter of women in the study were taking these agents and were 40 years or less; of these many were not using reliable contraception. These women are at risk of foetal malformation and poor perinatal outcomes if they become pregnant.

DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Slone Birth Defects Study, 1998-2010. POPULATION: A total of 5568 cases with birth defects and 7253 liveborn infants without malformations as controls. METHODS: Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for birth defects associated with prenatal exposure to maternal hypertensive disorders and/or antihypertensive medication were calculated using multivariable logistic regression analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Specific birth defects previously linked to maternal hypertension or antihypertensive medication use during pregnancy. RESULTS: Non-pharmacologically managed chronic hypertension was associated with a three-fold risk of oesophageal atresia (95\% CI 1.2-8.3), and pre-eclampsia superimposed on non-pharmacologically managed chronic hypertension was associated with ventricular septal defects (aOR 3.9, 95\% CI 1.3-11.7) and atrial septal defects (aOR 6.5, 95\% CI 1.8-23.7). For chronic hypertension that was pharmacologically treated early in pregnancy, increased risks were observed for first-degree hypospadias (aOR 2.9, 95\% CI 1.1-7.4). Non-pharmacologically managed pre-eclampsia was related to second-/third-degree hypospadias and ventricular septal defects. Pharmacological treatment for gestational hypertension was associated with a number of congenital heart defects. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm some, but not all, previously identified associations between pharmacologically treated and non-pharmacologically managed hypertensive disorders and specific birth defects. They support the hypothesis that physiological changes early in pregnancy that manifest in gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia may play a role in the aetiology of major birth defects, including congenital heart defects and hypospadias.},

Hypertension status was determined using blood pressure measurements and/or self-reported medication use. RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of hypertension in women of reproductive age was 7.7\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 6.9\%-8.5\%). The prevalence of anti-hypertensive pharmacologic therapy was 4.2\% (95\% CI 3.5\%-4.9\%). The prevalence of hypertension was relatively stable across the study period; the age and race adjusted odds of hypertension in 2007-2008 did not differ significantly from 1999-2000 (odds ratio 1.2, CI 0.8 to 1.7, p = 0.45). Significant independent risk factors associated with hypertension included older age, non-Hispanic black race (compared to non-Hispanic whites), diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and higher body mass index. The most commonly used antihypertensive medications included diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE), and beta blockers. CONCLUSION: Hypertension occurs in about 8\% of women of reproductive age. There are remarkable differences in the prevalence of hypertension between racial/ethnic groups. Obesity is a risk factor of particular importance in this population because it affects over 30\% of young women in the U.S., is associated with more than 4 fold increased risk of hypertension, and is potentially modifiable.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess disparities in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia among immigrant women from various world regions giving birth in six industrialised countries. DESIGN: Cross-country comparative study of linked population-based databases. SETTING: Provincial or regional obstetric delivery data from Australia, Canada, Spain and the USA and national data from Denmark and Sweden. POPULATION: All immigrant and non-immigrant women delivering in the six industrialised countries within the most recent 10-year period available to each participating centre (1995-2010). METHODS: Data was collected using standardised definitions of the outcomes and maternal regions of birth. Pooled data were analysed with multilevel models. Within-country analyses used stratified logistic regression to obtain odds ratios (OR) with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pre-eclampsia, eclampsia and pre-eclampsia with prolonged hospitalisation (cases per 1000 deliveries). RESULTS: There were 9,028,802 deliveries (3,031,399 to immigrant women). Compared with immigrants from Western Europe, immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America \& the Caribbean were at higher risk of pre-eclampsia (OR: 1.72; 95\% CI: 1.63, 1.80 and 1.63; 95\% CI: 1.57, 1.69) and eclampsia (OR: 2.12; 95\% CI: 1.61, 2.79 and 1.55; 95\% CI: 1.26, 1. 91), respectively, after adjustment for parity, maternal age and destination country. Compared with native-born women, European and East Asian immigrants were at lower risk in most industrialised countries. Spain exhibited the largest disparities and Australia the smallest. CONCLUSION: Immigrant women from Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America \& the Caribbean require increased surveillance due to a consistently high risk of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.},

	abstract = {Reduction of maternal mortality is a target within the Millennium Development Goals. Data on the incidence of preeclampsia and eclampsia, one of the main causes of maternal deaths, are required at both national and regional levels to inform policies. We conducted a systematic review of the incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) with the objective of evaluating its magnitude globally and in different regions and settings. We selected studies using pre-specified criteria, recorded database characteristics and assessed methodological quality of the eligible studies reporting incidence of any HDP during the period 2002-2010. A logistic model was then developed to estimate the global and regional incidence of HDP using pre-specified predictor variables where empiric data were not available. We found 129 studies meeting the inclusion criteria, from which 74 reports with 78 datasets reporting HDP were analysed. This represents nearly 39 million women from 40 countries. When the model was applied, the overall estimates are 4.6\% (95\% uncertainty range 2.7-8.2), and 1.4\% (95\% uncertainty range 1.0-2.0) of all deliveries for preeclampsia and eclampsia respectively, with a wide variation across regions. The figures we obtained give a general idea of the magnitude of the problem and suggest that some regional variations might exist. The absence of data in many countries is of concern, however, and efforts should be made to implement data collection and reporting for substantial statistics. The implementation of large scale surveys conducted during a short period of time could provide more reliable and up-to-date estimations to inform policy.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Eclampsia has been found to be a strong risk factor for epilepsy in the offspring, but it is unclear whether the risk also applies to the preceding condition, preeclampsia. METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study of 1537860 singletons born in Denmark (1978-2004). Information on preeclampsia (mild, severe, and unspecified), eclampsia, and epilepsy was obtained from the Danish National Hospital Register. Information on gestational age, birth weight, and Apgar score was obtained from the Danish Medical Birth Registry. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the incidence rate ratio of epilepsy for children who were exposed to preeclampsia or eclampsia in prenatal life. RESULTS: We identified 45288 (2.9\%) children who were exposed to preeclampsia (34823 to mild, 7043 to severe, and 3422 to unspecified preeclampsia) and 654 (0.04\%) to eclampsia during their prenatal life. We identified 20260 people who received a diagnosis of epilepsy during up to 27 years of follow-up in the entire cohort. Prenatal exposure to preeclampsia was associated with an increased risk for epilepsy among children with a gestational age at birth of at least 37 weeks. For mild preeclampsia, the incidence rate ratios were 1.16 among children born at term and 1.68 for children born postterm; for severe preeclampsia, the incidence rate ratios were 1.41 among children born at term and 2.57 among children born postterm. No associations between preeclampsia and epilepsy were found among children who were born preterm. Eclampsia was associated with epilepsy with an incidence rate ratio of 1.29 for children born at term and 5.03 for children born postterm. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to both preeclampsia and eclampsia was associated with an increased risk of epilepsy in children born after 37 weeks of gestation.},

	abstract = {Minimal data exist concerning the relationship between hypertensive pregnancy disorders and various subsequent cardiovascular events and the effect of type 2 diabetes mellitus on these. In a registry-based cohort study, we identified women delivering in Denmark from 1978 to 2007 with a first singleton (n=782 287) and 2 first consecutive singleton deliveries (n=536 419). The exposures were gestational hypertension and mild and severe preeclampsia. We adjusted for preterm delivery, small for gestational age, placental abruption, and stillbirth and, in a second model, we also adjusted for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The end points were subsequent hypertension, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, thromboembolic event, stroke, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The risk of subsequent hypertension was increased 5.31-fold (range: 4.90 to 5.75) after gestational hypertension, 3.61-fold (range: 3.43 to 3.80) after mild preeclampsia, and 6.07-fold (range: 5.45 to 6.77) after severe preeclampsia. The risk of subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus was increased 3.12-fold (range: 2.63 to 3.70) after gestational hypertension and 3.68-fold (range: 3.04 to 4.46) after severe preeclampsia. Women having 2 pregnancies both complicated by preeclampsia had a 6.00-fold (range: 5.40 to 6.67) increased risk of subsequent hypertension compared with 2.70-fold (range: 2.51 to 2.90) for women having preeclampsia in their first pregnancy only and 4.34-fold (range: 3.98 to 4.74) for women having preeclampsia in their second pregnancy only. The risk of subsequent thromboembolism was 1.03-fold (range: 0.73 to 1.45), 1.53-fold (range: 1.32 to 1.77), and 1.91-fold (range: 1.35 to 2.70) increased after gestational hypertension and mild and severe preeclampsia, respectively. Thus, hypertensive pregnancy disorders are strongly associated with subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, the latter independent of subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus. The severity, parity, and recurrence of these hypertensive pregnancy disorders increase the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events.},

Exposed children were compared to their unexposed siblings by using stratified Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals for metabolic and respiratory diseases. RESULTS: Exposed children had rather similar risks for metabolic disorders compared to their unexposed siblings. However, when the second child within each sib-pair was exposed, this child had an increased risk for respiratory diseases (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95\% confidence interval, 1.20-2.01). CONCLUSION: Factors leading to preeclampsia may shape susceptibility to metabolic or respiratory diseases in the offspring but a programming effect on respiratory diseases induced by preeclampsia cannot be ruled out.},

This paper overviews the most commonly used procedures to obtain adjusted prevalence ratios and extends the discussion to the analysis of clustered cross-sectional studies. METHODS: Prevalence ratios(PR) were estimated using logistic models with random effects. Their 95\% confidence intervals were obtained using delta method and clustered bootstrap. The performance of these approaches was evaluated through simulation studies. Using data from two studies with health-related outcomes in children, we discuss the interpretation of the measures of association and their implications. RESULTS: The results from data analysis highlighted major differences between estimated OR and PR. Results from simulation studies indicate an improved performance of delta method compared to bootstrap when there are small number of clusters. CONCLUSION: We recommend the use of logistic model with random effects for analysis of clustered data. The choice of method to estimate confidence intervals for PR (delta or bootstrap method) should be based on study design.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Apgar score is used for rapid assessment of newborns. Low five-minute Apgar score has been associated with increased risk of severe neurologic outcome, but data on milder outcomes, particularly in the long term, are limited. We aimed to examine the association of five-minute Apgar score with prevalence of neurologic disability and with cognitive function in early adulthood. METHODS: We conducted a prevalence study among draft-liable men born in Denmark in 1978-1983 and presenting for the mandatory army evaluation in a northern Danish conscription district. We linked records of this evaluation, which includes medical exam and intelligence testing, with the conscripts' records in the Medical Birth Registry, containing perinatal data. We examined prevalence of neurologic disability and of low cognitive function according to five-minute Apgar score. RESULTS: Less than 1\% (136/19,559) of the conscripts had 5-minute Apgar scores {\textless}7. Prevalence of neurologic disability was 2.2\% (435/19,559) overall; among conscripts with Apgar scores {\textless}7, 7-9, and 10 (reference), it was 8.8\%, 2.5\%, and 2.2\% respectively. The corresponding prevalences of low cognitive function (intelligence test score in the bottom quartile) were 34.9\%, 27.2\%, and 25.0\%. The outcomes were more prevalent if Apgar score {\textless}7 was accompanied by certain fetal or obstetric adversities. After accounting for perinatal characteristics, 5-minute Apgar score {\textless}7 was associated with prevalence ratios of 4.02 (95\% confidence interval: 2.24; 7.24) for neurologic disability and 1.33 (0.94; 1.88) for low cognitive function. CONCLUSION: A five-minute Apgar score {\textless}7 has a consistent association with prevalence of neurologic disability and with low cognitive function in early adulthood.},

Objective: To assess whether birth of an infant born with a major congenital anomaly was associated with higher maternal risk of mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study (n = 455250 women) used individual-level linked Danish registry data for mothers who gave birth to an infant with a major congenital anomaly (41508) between 1979 and 2010, with follow-up until December 31, 2014. A comparison cohort (413742) was constructed by randomly sampling, for each mother with an affected infant, up to 10 mothers matched on maternal age, parity, and year of infant's birth. Exposure: Live birth of an infant with a major congenital anomaly as defined by the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies classification system. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included cause-specific mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs) were adjusted for marital status, immigration status, income quartile (since 1980), educational level (since 1981), diabetes mellitus, modified Charlson comorbidity index score, hypertension, depression, history of alcohol-related disease, previous spontaneous abortion, pregnancy complications, smoking (since 1991), and body mass index (since 2004). Results: Mothers in both groups were a mean (SD) age of 28.9 (5.1) years at delivery. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 21 (12-28) years, there were 1275 deaths (1.60 per 1000 person-years) among 41508 mothers of a child with a major congenital anomaly vs 10112 deaths (1.27 per 1000 person-years) among 413742 mothers in the comparison cohort, corresponding to an absolute mortality rate difference of 0.33 per 1000 person-years (95\% CI, 0.24-0.42), an unadjusted HR of 1.27 (95\% CI, 1.20-1.35), and an adjusted HR of 1.22 (95\% CI, 1.15-1.29). Mothers with affected infants were more likely to die of cardiovascular disease (rate difference, 0.05 per 1000 person-years [95\% CI, 0.02-0.08]; adjusted HR, 1.26 [95\% CI, 1.04-1.53]), respiratory disease (rate difference, 0.02 per 1000 person-years [95\% CI, 0.00-0.04]; adjusted HR, 1.45 [95\% CI, 1.01-2.08]), and other natural causes (rate difference, 0.11 per 1000 person-years [95\% CI, 0.07-0.15]; adjusted HR, 1.50 [95\% CI, 1.27-1.76]). Conclusions and Relevance: In Denmark, having a child with a major congenital anomaly was associated with a small but statistically significantly increased mortality risk in the mother compared with women without an affected child. However, the clinical importance of this association is uncertain.},

	abstract = {This review highlights similarities in the epidemiology of endometrial and ovarian cancer, including highly correlated incidence rates and similar risk factor profiles. Factors that decrease risk for both cancers include a late menarche, early age at first birth, giving birth and breastfeeding, and use of oral contraceptives. Short or irregular cycles and late menopause are associated with increased risk for both. Other risk factors that appear to operate in a similar direction include decreased risk associated with IUD use or a tubal ligation, and increased risk associated with obesity, lack of exercise, and use of talc powders in genital hygiene. Estrogen excess is proposed as the underlying mechanism for most endometrial cancers, whereas incessant ovulation has been suggested as the explanation for ovarian cancer. However, an increased number of estimated ovulatory cycles correlates directly with risk for both endometrial and ovarian cancer, suggesting that reproductive tissue turnover with an accumulation of PTEN or p53 mutations represents a possible common mechanism. An immune-based explanation involving mucin proteins represents another common mechanism that could explain additional risk factors. Maintenance of ideal weight, breastfeeding children, use of oral contraceptives, and avoidance of talc powders in genital hygiene are measures that could lower the risk for both types of cancer. Careful selection of patients for prophylactic oophorectomy for those women who are coming to hysterectomy for benign disease is an additional measure to consider for ovarian cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In U.S. women, lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is 1.37\%, but some women are at a substantially lower or higher risk than this average. METHODS: We have characterized the distribution of lifetime risk in the general population. Published data on the relative risks and their variances for five well-accepted risk and protective factors for ovarian cancer, oral contraceptive use, parity, tubal ligation, endometriosis, and first-degree family history of ovarian cancer in conjunction with a genetic risk score using genome-wide significant common, low penetrance variants were used. The joint distribution of these factors (i.e., risk/protective factor profiles) was derived using control data from four U.S. population-based studies, providing a broad representation of women in the United States. RESULTS: A total of 214 combinations of risk/protective factors were observed, and the lifetime risk estimates ranged from 0.35\% [95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.29-0.42] to 8.78\% (95\% CI, 7.10-10.9). Among women with lifetime risk ranging from 4\% to 9\%, 73\% had no family history of ovarian cancer; most of these women had a self-reported history of endometriosis. CONCLUSIONS: Profiles including the known modifiable protective factors of oral contraceptive use and tubal ligation were associated with a lower lifetime risk of ovarian cancer. Oral contraceptive use and tubal ligation were essentially absent among the women at 4\% to 9\% lifetime risk. IMPACT: This work demonstrates that there are women in the general population who have a much higher than average lifetime risk of ovarian cancer. Preventive strategies are available. Should effective screening become available, higher than average risk women can be identified.},

	abstract = {AIM: To study the current prevalence and trends in overweight and obesity among children and adolescents in Denmark from 1995 to 2000-2002. METHODS: Cross-sectional national dietary surveys were conducted in 1995 and 2000-2002. The analysis was based on two random population samples from the Danish civil registration system. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from self-reported height and weight for 1,026 and 1,152 children and adolescents (4-18 years), who participated in 1995 and 2000-2002, respectively. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was defined according to the international age and gender-specific child BMI cut-off points. In the statistical analysis, overweight and obesity were included in the prevalence of overweight. RESULTS: Mean BMI increased significantly between 1995 and 2000-2002 for all combinations of age groups (4-6, 7-10, 11-14 and 15-18 years) and genders. Prevalence of overweight increased between survey years for boys and girls for all age groups (4-6, 7-10, 11-14 and 15-18 years), although formal statistical significance was not reached (p{\textgreater}0.05). When all children and adolescents (4-18 years) were analysed, the prevalence of overweight rose significantly from 10.9\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 9.0-12.8) to 14.4\% (95\% CI 12.5-16.3) between 1995 and 2000- 2002 (p=0.01), whereas the increase in the prevalence of obesity did not reach significance (1995, 2.3\% (95\% CI 1.3-3.3) vs. 2000-2002, 2.4\% (95\% CI 1.6-3.3); p=0.74). CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed a significant increase from 1995 to 2000-2002 in mean BMI for boys and girls for all age groups and a significant increase in the prevalence of overweight when all Danish children and adolescents (4-18 years) were analysed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Previous studies that have assessed the risk of developing epilepsy have failed to account for the competing risk of death, significant in the elderly where epilepsy incidence is highest. We report the lifetime risk for epilepsy, accounting for the competing risk of mortality. METHODS: Lifetime risk and cumulative incidence of epilepsy were examined among Rochester, MN, residents between 1960 and 1979. Age-, gender-, and calendar year-specific deaths were obtained for Rochester, MN. Lifetime risk was calculated as the conditional probability of developing epilepsy by a specific age for a person reaching that age who had not yet developed epilepsy. Lifetime risk and cumulative incidence were compared for age and time period. RESULTS: We identified 412 individuals with incident epilepsy diagnosed between January 1, 1960, and December 31, 1979. Lifetime risk was 1.6\% to age 50 and 3.0\% to age 80; cumulative incidence was 1.7\% to age 50 and 3.4\% to age 80. Similar differences were seen across epilepsy etiologies. Lifetime risk through 87 years of age increased over time from 3.5\% in 1960-1969 to 4.2\% in 1970-1979. CONCLUSIONS: One in 26 people will develop epilepsy during their lifetime. Lifetime risk provides an estimate of an individual's risk for epilepsy over his or her remaining lifetime, translates into the number of people who are expected to develop epilepsy, and assists health care planners as they estimate service needs for epilepsy.},

The diagnosis of ADHD requires a comprehensive clinical assessment including a detailed patient history, clinical interview and observation, and a thorough physical examination. A variety of other disorders can masquerade as ADHD or coexist with the disorder. The clinician must recognize environmental influences that may affect the severity of symptoms exhibited in the child or adolescent with ADHD. Clinically, treatment with a stimulant can be expected to result in an immediate, often dramatic, improvement in the core symptoms of ADHD. Studies published over the past 20 years indicate that the symptoms of ADHD, which were originally thought to diminish as a child matured, may persist into adolescence and adulthood. This article is a review of the most recent recommendations and clinical data regarding the diagnosis and management of ADHD in children and adolescents to assist with appropriate and prudent clinical decision making.},

RESULTS: Any vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy was associated with a 1.57-fold increased risk of preterm delivery (95\% CI: 1.16-2.11). Vaginal bleeding was most strongly related with spontaneous preterm labor (OR=2.10) and weakly associated with preterm premature rupture of membrane (OR=1.36) and medically induced preterm delivery (OR=1.32). As compared to women with no bleeding, those who bled during the first and second trimesters had a 6.24-fold increased risk of spontaneous preterm labor; and 2-3-fold increased risk of medically induced preterm delivery and preterm premature rupture of membrane, respectively.

The meta-analysis confirms an association of vaginal bleeding with adverse pregnancy outcomes, but identified discrepancies in the reported risks of vaginal bleeding and magnitudes of association between bleeding and adverse reproductive outcomes, observed across studies. These discrepancies may be attributed to inconsistent definitions of the timing and severity of vaginal bleeding.

We investigated the link between maternal cardiovascular disease prior to and subsequent to first trimester bleeding without miscarriage. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a registry-based retrospective cohort study of 796,915 women who gave birth to a singleton infant after 20 completed weeks in Denmark in 1978-2007. The exposures and endpoints were registry diagnoses of cardiovascular diseases preceding pregnancy, first trimester vaginal bleeding without miscarriage, and subsequent maternal cardiovascular disease. In the adjusted models, we considered preterm delivery, prelabor rupture of membranes, hypertensive pregnancy disorders, fetal growth restriction, placental abruption and stillbirth as possible confounders. We used logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models to assess the associations. RESULTS: Women with pre-pregnancy cardiovascular disease had a 2.2-fold (95\% CI 1.3-4.1) increased risk of first trimester bleeding without miscarriage, and first trimester bleeding without miscarriage was associated with a 1.6-fold (1.4-1.8) increase in risk of subsequent maternal ischemic hearth disease after adjusting for other adverse pregnancy outcomes.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autism is considered to have a genetic basis, although exposure to certain stimuli in the prenatal period has been implicated to be causal in some cases. Some investigations have shown an association with obstetric complications but findings have been inconsistent owing to differences in sampling and methods. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of obstetric factors with autism spectrum disorders for a cohort of children, using obstetric data contained in a statutory database collected at the time of birth. DESIGN: Subjects born in Western Australia between 1980 and 1995 and diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder by 1999 were included as cases (n = 465). Siblings of the cases (n = 481) and a random population-based control group (n = 1313) were compared with the cases on obstetric information contained in the Maternal and Child Health Research Database of Western Australia. RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, cases had significantly older parents and were more likely to be firstborn. Case mothers had greater frequencies of threatened abortion, epidural caudal anesthesia use, labor induction, and a labor duration of less than 1 hour. Cases were more likely to have experienced fetal distress, been delivered by an elective or emergency cesarean section, and had an Apgar score of less than 6 at 1 minute. Cases with a diagnosis of autism had more complications than those with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified or Asperger syndrome. Nonaffected siblings of cases were more similar to cases than control subjects in their profile of complications. CONCLUSIONS: Autism is unlikely to be caused by a single obstetric factor. The increased prevalence of obstetric complications among autism cases is most likely due to the underlying genetic factors or an interaction of these factors with the environment.},

	abstract = {The hypothesis that undescended testis is caused by an excess of maternal oestrogen in pregnancy has been tested indirectly in a case-control study comparing mothers of boys with undescended testis (83) and mothers of normal boys (129) born on the same day. The study concentrated on the gestation of the boys, but also investigated the mother's previous obstetric history and postnatal events in the boys. The hypothesis predicted that there should be an excess of nausea, vomiting and hypertension in mothers of cases, but in fact the pregnancies of the case and control mothers were similar in all respects except one. The exception was the increased liability of the mothers of cases to threatened abortion. Mothers of cases also had an increased tendency to miscarry in previous conceptions, a reduced number of deliberate terminations and evidence of decreased fertility. An alternative hypothesis is suggested which would explain these findings. This is that placental function is impaired in the gestation of affected boys and the secretion of human chorionic gonadotrophin is reduced. This leads to changes in fetal testicular function and possible maldescent. Those born with undescended testis were more likely to present to a general practitioner with illness in the first three years after birth and this difference was mainly due to asthma, eczema, jaundice and feeding difficulties.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE--To describe the incidence and prognosis of wheezing illness from birth to age 33 and the relation of incidence to perinatal, medical, social, environmental, and lifestyle factors. DESIGN--Prospective longitudinal study. SETTING--England, Scotland and Wales. SUBJECTS--18,559 people born on 3-9 March 1958. 5801 (31\%) contributed information at ages 7, 11, 16, 23, and 33 years. Attrition bias was evaluated using information on 14, 571 (79\%) subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--History of asthma, wheezy bronchitis, or wheezing obtained from interview with subjects' parents at ages 7, 11, and 16 and reported at interview by subjects at ages 23 and 33. RESULTS--The cumulative incidence of wheezing illness was 18\% by age 7, 24\% by age 16, and 43\% by age 33. Incidence during childhood was strongly and independently associated with pneumonia, hay fever, and eczema. There were weaker independent associations with male sex, third trimester antepartum haemorrhage, whooping cough, recurrent abdominal pain, and migraine. Incidence from age 17 to 33 was associated strongly with active cigarette smoking and a history of hay fever. There were weaker independent associations with female sex, maternal albuminuria during pregnancy, and histories of eczema and migraine. Maternal smoking during pregnancy was weakly and inconsistently related to childhood wheezing but was a stronger and significant independent predictor of incidence after age 16. Among 880 subjects who developed asthma or wheezy bronchitis from birth to age 7, 50\% had attacks in the previous year at age 7; 18\% at 11, 10\% at 16, 10\% at 23, and 27\% at 33. Relapse at 33 after prolonged remission of childhood wheezing was more common among current smokers and atopic subjects.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As well as being highly comorbid conditions, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID) share a number of clinically-relevant phenomena. This raises questions about similarities and overlap in diagnosis and aetiological pathways that may exist for both conditions. AIMS: To examine maternal conditions and perinatal factors for children diagnosed with an ASD, with or without ID, and children with ID of unknown cause, compared with unaffected children. METHODS: The study population comprised all live singleton births in Western Australia (WA) between January 1984 and December 1999 (N = 383,153). Univariate and multivariate multinomial logistic regression models were applied using a blocked modelling approach to assess the effect of maternal conditions, sociodemographic factors, labour and delivery characteristics and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: In univariate analyses mild-moderate ID was associated with pregnancy hypertension, asthma, urinary tract infection, some types of ante-partum haemorrhage, any type of preterm birth, elective C-sections, breech presentation, poor fetal growth and need for resuscitation at birth, with all factors showing an increased risk. Severe ID was positively associated with poor fetal growth and need for resuscitation, as well as any labour or delivery complication. In the multivariate analysis no maternal conditions or perinatal factors were associated with an increased risk of ASD without ID. However, pregnancy hypertension and small head circumference were associated with a reduced risk (OR = 0.64, 95\% CI: 0.43, 0.94; OR = 0.58, 95\% CI: 0.34, 0.96, respectively). For ASD with ID, threatened abortion before 20 weeks gestation and poor fetal growth were associated with an increased risk. CONCLUSION: Findings show that indicators of a poor intrauterine environment are associated with an elevated risk of ID, while for ASD, and particularly ASD without ID, the associations are much weaker. As such, these findings highlight the importance of accounting for the absence or presence of ID when examining ASD, if we are to improve our understanding of the causal pathways associated with these conditions.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous abortion, which is the loss of a pregnancy without outside intervention before 20 weeks' gestation, affects up to 20 percent of recognized pregnancies. Spontaneous abortion can be subdivided into threatened abortion, inevitable abortion, incomplete abortion, missed abortion, septic abortion, complete abortion, and recurrent spontaneous abortion. Ultrasonography is helpful in the diagnosis of spontaneous abortion, but other testing may be needed if an ectopic pregnancy cannot be ruled out. Chromosomal abnormalities are causative in approximately 50 percent of spontaneous abortions; multiple other factors also may play a role. Traditional treatment consisting of surgical evacuation of the uterus remains the treatment of choice in unstable patients. Recent studies suggest that expectant or medical management is appropriate in selected patients. Patients with a completed spontaneous abortion rarely require medical or surgical intervention. For women with incomplete spontaneous abortion, expectant management for up to two weeks usually is successful, and medical therapy provides little additional benefit. When patients are allowed to choose between treatment options, a large percentage will choose expectant management. Expectant management of missed spontaneous abortion has variable success rates, but medical therapy with intravaginal misoprostol has an 80 percent success rate. Physicians should be aware of psychologic issues that patients and their partners face after completing a spontaneous abortion. Women are at increased risk for significant depression and anxiety for up to one year after spontaneous abortion. Counseling to address feelings of guilt, the grief process, and how to cope with friends and family should be provided.},

METHODS: A total of 20 pregnant women with the complaint of vaginal bleeding during 7-18 gestational weeks and 20 healthy gestational week matched pregnant women were included in the study. Maternal plasma Kp-10 levels were measured with the enzyme immunoassay method. Adverse pregnancy outcomes like intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery, preeclampsia and low birth weight were evaluated in both groups. RESULTS: Maternal plasma Kp-10 levels (p = 0.01) and birth weight (p = 0.06) were found to be lower in women with bleeding. Intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery and intrauterine exitus were noted more commonly in women with bleeding (10 vs. 0\%, 25 vs. 15\% and 20 vs. 0\%, p = 0.08). Preeclampsia were developed in 5\% of both groups. Kp-10 levels showed positive correlation with gestational week (p = 0.02) and ALT levels (p = 0.02).

These must be interpreted correctly for a proper understanding of the findings. METHODS: The authors present basic statistical concepts required for the analysis of nominal data, referring to standard works in statistics. RESULTS: The relative risk and odds ratio are defined to be indices for the relationship between two binary quantities (e.g., exposure--yes/no and disease--yes/no). The topics dealt with in this article include the effect of sample size on the length of the confidence interval and the p-value, and also inaccuracies caused by measuring error. Exposures are often expressed on a three-level scale (none, low, high). The authors also consider the 2 x 3 table as an extension of the 2 x 2 table and discuss the categorization of continuous measurements. Typically, more than one factor is involved in the development of a disease. The effect that a further factor can have on the observed relationship between the exposure and the disease is discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Sample size, measurement error, categorization, and confounders influence the statistical interpretation of 2 x 2 tables in many ways. Readers of scientific publications should know the inherent problems in the interpretation of simple 2 x 2 tables and check that the authors have taken these into account adequately in analyzing and interpreting their data.},

METHODS: This is a prospective population-based cohort study. A questionnaire survey was conducted on 4342 singleton pregnancies by trained doctors. Binary logistic regression was used to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and 95\% con fi dence intervals (95\% CI). RESULTS: Vaginal bleeding occurred among 1050 pregnant women, the incidence of vaginal bleeding was 24.2\%, 37.4\% of whom didn't see a doctor, 62.6\% of whom saw a doctor for vaginal bleeding. Binary logistic regression demonstrated that bleeding with seeing a doctor was significantly associated with preterm birth (RR 1.84, 95\% CI 1.25-2.69) and bleeding without seeing a doctor was related to increased of low birth weight (RR 2.52, 95\% CI 1.34-4.75) and was 1.97-fold increased of small for gestational age (RR 1.97, 95\% CI 1.19-3.25).

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between maternal complications and postpartum depression (PPD) among postpartum women in Qatar by using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) as well as a structured questionnaire. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of PPD of 1379 postpartum women within 6 months of delivery attending the primary healthcare centers of the State of Qatar. RESULTS: The prevalence of PPD was 17.6\% in the studied mothers. The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors for PPD included various socio-demographic risk factors such as education, occupation, consanguinity and access to transportation. Amongst the maternal factors studied, history of unplanned pregnancy and infertility and other medical complications such as gestational diabetes, heart disease, threatened abortion and cesarean section were found to be risk factors for PPD. Amongst the postpartum women with maternal complications, items related to feeling scared and panicky and feeling sad and miserable were the most frequently reported symptoms of depression. These women were also more likely to be experiencing sleep difficulty (p = 0.029) compared to women without maternal complications. CONCLUSION: While socio-demographic risk factors are well studied in the PPD literature, there is much less information on the impact of maternal complications on the psychological status of postpartum women. Postpartum women, especially those with maternal complications, need close screening and have quick access to mental healthcare within integrated reproductive health services.},

Few maternal characteristics or exposures were predictive of bleeding, and those that were associated with an increased risk of bleeding were only marginally so. Risk factors included advanced maternal age, previous spontaneous or induced abortion, working during pregnancy, and certain gynecologic conditions (fibroids, cervical inflammation, and ovarian cysts). Severity of bleeding was examined in relation to birth weight and length of gestation at delivery. Light bleeding during pregnancy was not associated with decreased birth weight or with shortened gestation at delivery. Heavy bleeding was associated with a decrease in mean birth weight of about 100 g (p less than 0.05) but was not significantly associated with the risk of low birth weight (odds ratio (OR) = 1.7, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.9-3.3).

	abstract = {The influence of first trimester uterine bleeding on the incidence of antepartum haemorrhage was evaluated in 374 patients. The incidence of abruptio placentae and placenta previa were 1.0\% and 2.0\% respectively in these patients. In the control group of patients who did not experience first trimester uterine bleeding, the incidence was 0.4\% for abruptio placentae and 1.0\% for placenta previa. The study indicates that first trimester threatened abortion is associated with 2 1/2 fold risk of abruptio placenta and placenta previa than in the general obstetric population. The possible reasons for these incidences are discussed.
PIP: A retrospective case-control study suggested that first-trimester threatened abortion is significantly associated with an increased risk of both abruptio placenta and placenta previa. The antenatal and delivery records of 374 women treated at University College Hospital in Ibadan, Nigeria, for period or threatened abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy were compared to those of 500 randomly selected control patients without a history of threatened abortion. Four cases (1.07\%) and two controls (0.4\%) developed abruptio placenta, while nine cases (2.41\%) and five controls (1.0\%) had placenta previa. Thus, the risk of both complications was increased 2.5-fold for women with threatened first-trimester abortion. Since bleeding usually indicates some degree of separation of the chorion from decidua, it is speculated that residual tissue defects or weak points remain between the placenta and decidua at the site of bleeding and cause villous, decidua, or chorionic damage. Women with threatened first-trimester abortion should be followed carefully to ensure placental localization.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Threatened miscarriage is a common complication in the first trimester of pregnancy and is often associated with anxiety regarding pregnancy outcome. OBJECTIVE: We undertook a systematic review to explore the effects of threatened miscarriage in the first trimester on maternal and perinatal outcomes. SEARCH STRATEGY: An electronic literature search using MEDLINE and EMBASE, and bibliographies of retrieved primary articles. No language restrictions were applied. SELECTION CRITERIA: All studies analysing outcomes of first-trimester bleeding where viability was confirmed on ultrasound or the pregnancy continued beyond viability. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data on study characteristics, quality and accuracy. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager software. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome was broadly categorised into maternal and perinatal outcomes. The chief maternal outcomes included pre-eclampsia/eclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension, antepartum haemorrhage, preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) and mode of delivery. The perinatal outcomes evaluated were preterm delivery, low birthweight, intrauterine growth restriction, perinatal mortality, indicators of perinatal morbidity (Apgar scores and neonatal unit admission) and presence of congenital anomalies. MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Women with threatened miscarriage had a significantly higher incidence of antepartum haemorrhage due to placenta praevia [odds ratio (OR) 1.62, 95\% CI 1.19, 2.22] or antepartum haemorrhage of unknown origin (OR 2.47, 95\% CI 1.52, 4.02) when compared with those without first-trimester bleeding. They were more likely to experience PPROM (OR 1.78, 95\% CI 1.28, 2.48), preterm delivery (OR 2.05, 95\% CI 1.76, 2.4) and to have babies with intrauterine growth restriction (OR 1.54, 95\% CI 1.18, 2.00). First-trimester bleeding was associated with significantly higher rates of perinatal mortality (OR 2.15, 95\% CI 1.41, 3.27) and low-birthweight babies (OR 1.83, 95\% CI 1.48, 2.28). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Threatened miscarriage in the first trimester is associated with increased incidence of adverse maternal and perinatal outcome.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Limited studies have evaluated the risk factors for congenital heart defects (CHDs) in China and compared them for different types of CHDs. This study examined risk factors between isolated and multiple CHDs as well as among CHDs subtypes in Guangdong, Southern China. METHODS: This population-based case-control study included 4,034 pairs of case and control infants enrolled in the Guangdong Registry of CHD study, 2004-2013. Multivariate logistic regression was used to compute adjusted odds ratios (ORs) while simultaneously controlling for confounders. RESULTS: Multiple maternal environmental exposures, including living in newly renovated rooms, residential proximity to main traffic, paternal smoking, and maternal occupation as manual worker, were significantly associated with CHDs with ORs ranging 1.30-9.43. Maternal perinatal diseases (including maternal fever, diabetes, influenza, and threatened abortion), maternal medication use (antibiotic use), advanced maternal age, low socioeconomic status, and paternal alcohol intake were also significantly associated with CHDs, with ORs ranging 1.60-3.96. Isolated CHDs and multiple defects have different profiles of risk factors, while subtype of CHD shares common risk factors. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that maternal environmental exposures/occupation and perinatal diseases/medication use were dominant risk factors associated with CHDs in Southern China. Isolated and multiple CHDs may have different etiologic factors.},

The enzyme confers an invasive ability to cytotrophoblasts and degrades the endometrial matrix as the cells infiltrate the decidua to keep up with placental growth. Since tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) can induce the synthesis of MMP-9, we investigated the patterns of changes in and correlation between placental villous MMP-9 and TNF-alpha expressions throughout normal human gestation. Placentas were obtained from 179 normal pregnant women who underwent elective abortion or term delivery. Chorionic villi isolated from placental samples were grouped as first, second, and third trimester (70/7-130/7, 131/7-236/7, and 370/7-424/7 weeks, respectively). Chorionic villous TNF-alpha and MMP-9 proteins were assayed using enzyme immunoassay kits. There were significant differences in MMP-9 and TNF-alpha protein expressions among the trimester groups ( P = .001). The MMP-9 protein increased progressively with an increase in gestational age (GA), but TNF-alpha peaked in the second trimester. Within each trimester group, we searched for the effects of variation of GA in days on the 2 variables. A significant positive correlation between MMP-9 and GA was noted in the first trimester ( r = 0.364, P = .005). No other comparisons were significant. When GA was controlled for, partial correlation revealed a significant positive correlation between TNF-alpha and MMP-9 only in the second trimester ( r = 0.300, P = .018). We hypothesize that the TNF-alpha peak and the positive correlation between TNF-alpha and MMP-9 in the second trimester of normal human gestation could contribute toward a successful pregnancy outcome.},

On day 12 of gestation, rats were injected intraperitoneally with saline, LPS, native or heat-inactivated (HI) rHIL 1 alpha, or rH-TNF alpha. Seven days later, grossly abnormal implantation sites and fetal demise were observed in rats injected with rHIL-1, rHTNF, or LPS but not in those injected with saline or HI-cytokines.

	abstract = {Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-related disorder manifested as maternal hypertension in pregnancy (HTN-Preg) and fetal growth restriction. Placental ischemia could be an initiating event that leads to abnormal vascular and uteroplacental remodeling in HTN-Preg; however, the molecular targets and intermediary mechanisms involved are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that placental ischemia could target vascular and uteroplacental matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) through an inflammatory cytokine-mediated mechanism. MMP levels and distribution were measured in the aorta, uterus, and placenta of normal pregnant (Preg) rats and pregnant rats with reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP). Maternal blood pressure was higher and the litter size and pup weight were lower in RUPP compared with Preg rats. Gelatin zymography showed prominent uterine MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity that was dependent on the amount of loaded protein. At saturating protein loading, both gelatin and casein zymography revealed two additional bands corresponding to MMP-1 and MMP-7 that were greater in the aorta, uterus, and placenta of RUPP compared with Preg rats. Western blots and immunohistochemistry confirmed increased MMP-1 and MMP-7 in the aorta, uterus, and placenta of RUPP versus Preg rats. The levels of MMP-1 and MMP-7 substrate collagen type I were greater in tissues of RUPP compared with Preg rats. In organ culture, TNF-alpha increased MMP-1 and MMP-7 in the aorta, uterus, and placenta of Preg rats, and a TNF-alpha antagonist prevented the increases in MMPs in tissues of RUPP rats. Thus, placental ischemia, possibly through TNF-alpha, increases vascular and uteroplacental MMP-1 and MMP-7, which, in turn, alter collagen deposition and cause inadequate tissue remodeling in HTN-Preg. Cytokine antagonists may reverse the increase in MMP-1 and MMP-7 expression/activity and, in turn, restore proper vascular and uteroplacental remodeling in HTN-Preg and preeclampsia.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY The molecular mechanisms of preeclampsia are unclear, making it difficult to predict, prevent, or manage the pregnancy-associated disorder. This study showed that placental ischemia, possibly through the release of TNF-alpha, causes increases in the levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and MMP-7, which could alter collagen deposition and cause inadequate uteroplacental and vascular remodeling in hypertension in pregnancy. The data suggest that targeting MMP-1 and MMP-7 and their upstream modulators, such as TNF-alpha, could provide a new approach in the management of hypertension in pregnancy and preeclampsia.},

METHODS: ETS exposure, birth weight, blood sample and covariates were collected from 195 pregnant women delivered term LBW infants and 195 controls delivered normal birth weight infants in two Maternity and Child Hospitals in Guangdong, China. Maternal serum IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were measured by flow cytometry. Logistic regression models and path analyses explored the mediation effects of maternal IL-1beta and TNF-alpha on the association between ETS exposure and LBW. RESULTS: LBW was significantly associated with maternal ETS exposure (OR = 2.14 (95\% CI =1.06-4.32)). TNF-alpha and IL-1beta were significantly associated with both LBW (OR = 1.87 (1.41-2.47) and OR = 1.53 (1.14-2.05)) and ETS (beta = 0.32 (0.04-0.60) and beta = 0.27 (0.05-0.49)). Traditional mediation analyses indicated the separate mediation effect of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta was 32.2\% and 24.6\%, respectively. Path analysis revealed the combined mediation effects of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta as 29.4\% in the pathway from ETS exposure to LBW.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Pregnancy-induced analgesia develops during late pregnancy, but it is unclear whether this analgesia is effective against neuropathic pain. The detailed molecular mechanisms underlying pregnancy-induced analgesia have not been investigated. We examined the antinociceptive effect of pregnancy-induced analgesia in a neuropathic pain model and the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Iba-1, and c-Fos in the spinal dorsal horn just before parturition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Female Sprague Dawley rats (200-250 g) were randomly assigned to one of four groups (pregnant + chronic constriction injury [CCI]; pregnant + sham injury; not pregnant + CCI; and not pregnant + sham injury). Separate groups were used for the behavioral and tissue analyses. CCI of the left sciatic nerve was surgically induced 3 days after confirming pregnancy in the pregnancy group or on day 3 in the not pregnant group. The spinal cord was extracted 18 days after CCI. TNF-alpha, GFAP, Iba-1, and c-Fos expression levels in the spinal dorsal horn were measured by Western blot analysis. Mechanical threshold was tested using von Frey filaments. RESULTS: The lowered mechanical threshold induced by CCI was significantly attenuated within 1 day before parturition and decreased after delivery. TNF-alpha expression in CCI rats was decreased within 1 day before parturition. Further, GFAP, Iba-1, and c-Fos expression in the spinal dorsal horn was reduced in the pregnant rats. Serum TNF-alpha in all groups was below measurable limits. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that pregnancy-induced analgesia suppresses neuropathic pain through reducing spinal levels of TNF-alpha, GFAP, Iba-1, and c-Fos in a rat model of CCI.},

	abstract = {Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a central regulator of inflammation, and TNF-alpha antagonists may be effective in treating inflammatory disorders in which TNF-alpha plays a major pathogenic role. TNF-alpha has also been associated with inflammatory mechanisms related to implantation, placentation, and pregnancy outcome. TNF-alpha is secreted by immune cells and works by binding to TNFR1 and TNFR2 cell receptors. TNF-alpha is also related to JAK/STAT pathways, which opens up hypothetical new targets for modifying. The accurate balance between Th1 cytokines, mainly TNF-alpha, Th17, and Th2, particularly IL-10 is essential to achieve good obstetric outcomes. TNF-alpha targeted therapy could be rational in treating women with obstetric complication related to overproduction of TNF-alpha, such as recurrent pregnancy loss, early and severe pre-eclampsia, and recurrent implantation failure syndrome, all "idiopathic" or related to aPL positivity. Along the same lines, Th1 cytokines, mainly TNF- alpha, play a leading pathogenic role in rheumatic and systemic autoimmune diseases occurring in women and, to a lesser extent, in men of reproductive age. These disorders have to be clinically silent before pregnancy can be recommended, which is usually only possible to achieve after intensive anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive treatment, TNF-alpha blockers included. Physicians should be aware of the theoretic potential but low embryo-fetal toxicity risk of these drugs during pregnancy. From an updated review in May 2016, we can conclude that TNF-alpha blockers are useful in certain "refractory" cases of inflammatory disorders related to poor obstetric outcomes and infertility. Furthermore, TNF-alpha blockers can be safely used during the implantation period and pregnancy. Breastfeeding is also permitted with all TNF-alpha inhibitors. Since data on the actual mechanism of action of JAK-STAT in inflammatory obstetric disorders including embryo implantation are scarce, for the time being, therapeutic interventions in this setting should be discouraged. Finally, adverse effects on sperm quality, or causing embryo-fetal anomalies, in men treated with TNF inhibitors have not been described.},

It is concluded that in first-trimester TACP with adverse outcome, a distinct immune response, as reflected by elevated maternal IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and unaltered IL-6 levels, is relevant to a negative obstetric outcome.},

	abstract = {Prenatal events appear to program hormonal homeostasis, contributing to the development of somatic disorders at an adult age. The aim of this study was to examine whether maternal exposure to cytokines or to dexamethasone (Dxm) would be followed by hormonal consequences in the offspring at adult age. Pregnant rats were injected on days 8, 10, and 12 of gestation with either human interleukin-6 (IL-6) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or with Dxm. Control dams were injected with vehicle. All exposed offspring developed increased body weight (P {\textless} 0.05--0.001), apparently due to an increase of 30--40\% in adipose tissue weight (P {\textless} 0.05--0.01). Corticosterone response to stress was increased in the IL-6 group (P {\textless} 0.05-0.01). Dxm-treated male rats exhibited blunted Dexamethasone suppression test results. In male rats, insulin sensitivity was decreased after IL-6 exposure (P {\textless} 0.01), whereas basal insulin was elevated in the TNF-alpha group (P {\textless} 0.01). In female rats, plasma testosterone levels were higher in all exposed groups compared with controls (P {\textless} 0.01--0.001), with the exception of Dxm-exposed offspring. Males in the TNF-alpha group showed decreased locomotor activity (P {\textless} 0.05), and females in the IL-6 group showed increased locomotor activity (P {\textless} 0.05). These results indicate that prenatal exposure to cytokines or Dxm leads to increased fat depots in both genders. In females, cytokine exposure was followed by a state of hyperandrogenicity. The results suggest that prenatal exposure to cytokines or Dxm can induce gender-specific programming of neuroendocrine regulation with consequences in adult life.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We examined the relation between early life infections and adult obesity. METHODS: A cohort of Danish males who underwent mandatory army fitness examinations was studied. Hospitalizations for childhood infections and their mothers' hospitalization for infection during pregnancy were identified via the Danish National Registry of Patients. The outcome was obesity (body mass index {\textgreater}/= 30 kg/m(2)) at conscription. We calculated prevalence odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) associating the obesity with whether the conscript had a hospitalization for infection up to age 5, and separately, whether the conscript's mother was hospitalized for an infection prenatally. RESULTS: Of the 17,456 men, 13\% had a childhood infection (8.2\% of whom were obese, compared with 7.4\% without childhood infection); 1.2\% of conscripts were exposed to a prenatal infection (10\% of whom were obese, compared with 7.4\% without prenatal infection). For childhood infection, the adjusted OR was 1.21 (95\% CI, 1.01-1.44); stratified analyses suggested the association may be greater among conscripts born preterm (adjusted OR, 2.08; 95\% CI, 1.06-4.09), whereas among the conscripts who were full term, the adjusted OR was 1.15 (95\% CI, 0.96-1.38). For prenatal infection, the adjusted OR was 1.34 (95\% CI, 0.82-2.19). CONCLUSIONS: We found a small association between both prenatal and childhood infections and prevalent obesity in early adulthood, although the results may be partly explained by unmeasured confounders.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Relative risk is a summary metric that is commonly used in epidemiological investigations. Increasingly, epidemiologists are using log-binomial models to study the impact of a set of predictor variables on a single binary outcome, as they naturally offer relative risks. However, standard statistical software may report failed convergence when attempting to fit log-binomial models in certain settings. The methods that have been proposed in the literature for dealing with failed convergence use approximate solutions to avoid the issue. This research looks directly at the log-likelihood function for the simplest log-binomial model where failed convergence has been observed, a model with a single linear predictor with three levels. The possible causes of failed convergence are explored and potential solutions are presented for some cases. RESULTS: Among the principal causes is a failure of the fitting algorithm to converge despite the log-likelihood function having a single finite maximum. Despite these limitations, log-binomial models are a viable option for epidemiologists wishing to describe the relationship between a set of predictors and a binary outcome where relative risk is the desired summary measure. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiologists are encouraged to continue to use log-binomial models and advocate for improvements to the fitting algorithms to promote the widespread use of log-binomial models.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Prenatal exposure to antibacterials may permanently dysregulate fetal metabolic patterns via epigenetic pathways or by altering maternal microbiota. We examined the association of prenatal exposure to systemic antibacterials with overweight and obesity in schoolchildren. SUBJECTS/METHODS: We conducted a prevalence study among Danish schoolchildren aged 7-16 years using data from routine school anthropometric evaluations conducted during 2002-2013. Prenatal exposure to antibacterials was ascertained by using maternal prescription dispensations and infection-related hospital admissions during pregnancy. We defined overweight and obesity among the children using standard age- and sex-specific cutoffs. We computed sex-specific adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) of overweight and obesity associated with exposure to prenatal antibacterials, adjusting for maternal age at delivery, marital status, smoking in pregnancy and multiple gestation; we also stratified the analyses by birth weight. RESULTS: Among 9886 schoolchildren, 3280 (33\%) had prenatal exposure to antibacterials. aPRs associated with the exposure were 1.26 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.45) for overweight and 1.29 (95\% CI: 1.03-1.62) for obesity. Among girls, aPRs were 1.16 (95\% CI: 0.95-1.42) for overweight and 1.27 (95\% CI: 0.89 to 1.82) for obesity. Among boys, aPRs were 1.37 (95\% CI: 1.13-1.66) for overweight and 1.29 (95\% CI: 0.96-1.73) for obesity. The aPR for overweight was higher among schoolchildren with birth weight {\textless}3500 g (aPR: 1.30, 95\% CI: 1.05-1.61) than in schoolchildren with birth weight 3500 g (aPR: 1.18, 95\% CI: 0.95-1.46). Inversely, the association for obesity was higher among schoolchildren with birth weight 3500 g (aPR: 1.35, 95\% CI: 1.00-1.81) than among those who were {\textless}3500 g at birth (aPR: 1.16, 95\% CI: 0.82-1.65).

METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study over a period of 1 year of 94 Maltese women presenting with TM at the same hospital and compared their clinical data with those of 564 age-matched controls from the National Obstetric Information System (NOIS) of Malta. Main outcome measures included gestational age and weight at delivery and incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes. A pilot study was carried out, where in subgroups of 10 women with TM (n=10), non-pregnant women (n=12), normal pregnant controls (n=9) and women presenting with missed-miscarriage (n=11), the plasma levels of beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (beta-hCG), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interferon gamma (IFNgamma), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and TNF-receptors 1 (R1) and 2 (R2) were measured. RESULTS: Of the women presenting with TM, 25 (26.6\%) proceeded to complete miscarriage. The TM group had also a significantly higher incidence of antepartum haemorrhage (p{\textless}0.005), pre-eclampsia (p{\textless}0.05), foetal growth restriction (p{\textless}0.05), premature labour (p{\textless}0.001) and retained placenta (p{\textless}0.005). In the pilot biochemical analysis, significantly (p{\textless}0.05) higher levels of TNFalpha and lower levels of TNFR2 were found in the TM subgroup compared to non-pregnant controls. The ratio TNFalpha/IL-10 was significantly (p{\textless}0.05) higher and the beta-hCG levels was significantly lower (p{\textless}0.01) in missed-miscarriage and non-pregnant subgroups than in TM and normal pregnant controls. The IFNgamma/1L-10 and IFNgamma/1L-6 ratio were significantly ({\textless}0.001) different between the four subgroups with the lowest level found in TM. No similar gradient was found for the TNFalpha/1L-6 ratio. CONCLUSION: Women presenting with TM are at significantly increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome and the pathophysiology of these conditions involves a change in the Th1/Th2 balance. Changes in levels of cytokines could help to predict and thus prevent the development of some of these complications.},

The incidence of low and very low birth weight deliveries, although significantly higher compared with the control population, was not affected independently by this early pregnancy complication on logistic regression (OR 1.3, 0.8-1.9). The early neonatal mortality rates were significantly higher in the threatened miscarriage group, which on logistic regression was due independently to preterm delivery, placental abruption and low birth weight deliveries. All forms of APH were significantly higher in term deliveries complicated by threatened miscarriage.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Threatened abortion is the most common complication in the first half of pregnancy. Most of these pregnancies continue to term with or without treatment. Spontaneous abortion occurs in less than 30\% of these women. Threatened abortion had been shown to be associated with increased incidence of antepartum haemorrhage, preterm labour and intra uterine growth retardation. OBJECTIVE: This study was to asses the outcome of threatened abortion following treatment. METHODS: This prospective study was carried out in Dhulikhel Hospital - Kathmandu University Hospital from January 2009 till May 2010. Total 70 cases of threatened abortion were selected, managed with complete bed rest till 48 hrs of cessation of bleeding, folic acid supplementation, uterine sedative, and hormonal treatment till 28 weeks of gestation. Ultrasonogram was performed for diagnosis and to detect the presence of subchorionic hematoma. Patients were followed up until spontaneous abortion or up to delivery of the fetus. The measures used for the analysis were maternal age, parity, gestational age at the time of presentation, previous abortions, presence of subchorionic hematoma, complete abortion, continuation of pregnancy, antepartum hemorrhage, intrauterine growth retardation and intrauterine death of fetus. RESULTS: Out of 70 cases subchorionic haematoma was found in 30 (42.9\%) cases. There were 12 (17.1\%) patients who spontaneously aborted after diagnosis of threatened abortion during hospital stay, 5 (7.1\%) aborted on subsequent visits while 53 (75.8\%) continued pregnancy till term. Among those who continued pregnancy intrauterine growth retardation was seen in 7 (13.2\%), antepartum hemorrhage in 4 (7.5\%), preterm premature rupture of membrane in 3 (5.66\%) and IUD in 3 (5.66\%). Spontaneous abortion was found more in cases with subchorionic hematoma of size more than 20 cm2. CONCLUSION: In cases of threatened abortion with or without the presence of subchorionic hematoma, prognostic outcome is better following treatment with bed rest, uterine sedatives, folic acid supplementation and hormonal treatment.},

Spontaneous preterm delivery [126 cases (25.2\%) vs. 47 cases (9.4\%), P=0.001, adj RR=1.4, CI 95\%=1.2-1.5], PROM [51 cases (10.2\%) vs. 24 cases (4.8\%), P=0.02, adj RR=2.1, CI95\%=1.2-2.3], placental abruption [20 cases (4\%) vs. 7 cases (1.4\%) P=0.01, adj RR=1.1, CI 95\%=1.01-1.2], were more in the case group. There were no differences between the 2 groups with regard to Preeclampsia, small for gestational age (SGA), and cesarean deliveries. Neonatal weight (in term pregnancies) in the case group was lower than in the control group (3046.4+/-560.8 g vs. 3317.6+/-432 g, P=0.001). There was a significant relationship between the number of bleeding episodes, spontaneous preterm delivery and placental abruption and there was also a significant relationship between the amount of bleeding and placental abruption. CONCLUSION: Threatened abortion increases the rate of spontaneous preterm delivery, PROM and placental abruption, and decreases the neonatal weight. Therefore threatened abortion indicates a high risk pregnancy and, as such, demands more serious prenatal care.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine various pre-, peri-, and neonatal factors in autistic participants and in pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) participants and to compare the incidence of each factor to that of the normal population. METHODS: Seventy-four participants (66 males, 8 females) were diagnosed with autism at 2.5 through 4 years of age using the most accurate and up-to-date methods, including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. At age 5, all participants were reevaluated using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Revised, resulting in 61 autistic and 13 PDD-NOS participants. Twenty-eight pre-, peri-, and neonatal factors were examined in these 2 groups using both medical records and parental interviews. Incidences were compared with those of the US population as reported in the Report of Final Natality Statistics, 1995. This grand scale population group was used to closely approximate comparison to a normal, unbiased population. Results were analyzed using the binomial probability test, with a P value of {\textless}.05, constituting a significant difference in incidence. A Bonferroni correction was applied to the data to adjust for the number of factors investigated. RESULTS: Although most of the factors showed comparable incidences between the index and control groups, several factors showed statistically significant differences. Following the Bonferroni correction, the autism group was found to have a significantly higher incidence of uterine bleeding, a lower incidence of maternal vaginal infection, and less maternal use of contraceptives during conception when compared with the general population. Similarly, the PDD-NOS group showed a higher incidence of hyperbilirubinemia when compared with the general population. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support previous findings suggesting a consistent association of unfavorable events in pregnancy, delivery, and the neonatal phase and the pervasive developmental disorders. However, interpretation of the meaningfulness of these results is difficult, as the specific complications that carried the highest risk of autism and PDD-NOS represented various forms of pathologic processes with no presently apparent unifying feature. Additional studies are needed to corroborate and strengthen these associations, as well as to determine the possibility of an underlying unifying pathological process. This study's analysis of obstetric and neonatal complications in combination with the use of participants diagnosed at an early age provides some interesting concepts to consider. Perhaps future research will confirm certain pre-, peri-, and neonatal associations that could be used to generate a high-risk historical profile with which to use in conjunction with currently employed diagnostic tools. This may, in turn, help to determine the reliability of a diagnosis of autism in younger children, leading to earlier intervention and assistance for an improved outcome in long-term functionality and quality of life.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal risk factors for children autism. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science were used to search for studies that examined the prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal risk factors for children autism. A fixed-effects model or random-effects model was used to pool the overall effect estimates. RESULTS: Data from 37,634 autistic children and 12,081,416 nonautistic children enrolled in 17 studies were collated. During the prenatal period, the factors associated with autism risk were maternal and paternal age{\textgreater}/=35 years, mother's and father's race: White and Asian, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, maternal and paternal education college graduate+, threatened abortion, and antepartum hemorrhage. During perinatal period, the factors associated with autism risk were caesarian delivery, gestational age{\textless}/=36 weeks, parity{\textgreater}/=4, spontaneous labor, induced labor, no labor, breech presentation, preeclampsia, and fetal distress. During the postnatal period, the factors associated with autism risk were low birth weight, postpartum hemorrhage, male gender, and brain anomaly. Parity{\textgreater}/=4 and female were associated with a decreased risk of autism. In addition, exposure to cigarette smoking, urinary infection, mother's and father's race: Black and Hispanic, mother's country of birth outside Europe and North America, umbilical cord around neck, premature membrane rupture, 5-minutes Apgar score{\textless}7, and respiratory infection were not associated with increased risk of autism. CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis confirmed the relation between some prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal factors with autism. All these factors were examined individually, thus it was still unclear that whether these factors are causal or play a secondary role in the development of autism. Further studies are needed to verify our findings, and investigate the effects of multiple factors on autism, rather than the single factor.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of first and/or second trimester vaginal bleeding on pregnancy outcome. DESIGN: A prospective one-year birth cohort. SETTING: Two northernmost administrative districts of Finland. PATIENTS: 8718 singleton pregnancies, of whom 807 (9.3\%) reported bleeding during the first (601) and/or second trimester (206); light bleeding in 595 cases and heavy bleeding in 212. The remaining 7911 women served as a reference group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Low birth weight rate (LBW), preterm birth rate, congenital malformations and perinatal mortality rate. RESULTS: Bleeding was most frequent in women of more advanced age ({\textgreater} or = 35 years old), with previous miscarriages, with infertility problems or using an IUCD prior to the pregnancy. Parity, smoking and social status were not associated with bleeding. Caesarean section rate and placental complications during the third trimester and at delivery were more common among the bleeders than in the reference group. The LBW rate was three-fold among the bleeders and the preterm birth rate two-fold. The risk (OR) of a LBW infant among second trimester bleeders was 4.1 (95\% CI 2.6-6.4), that of preterm birth 2.9 (95\% CI 1.9-4.6), and that of congenital malformations 2.9 (95\% CI 1.7-4.7). No association existed between bleeding and perinatal mortality.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of threatened miscarriage on second-trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) levels and pregnancy outcome; and to study the significance of ultrasound evidence of an intrauterine hematoma on pregnancy outcome in these patients.
METHODS: A retrospective, case-control study was performed on 144 women presenting with bleeding in the first trimester and 144 age-matched control subjects who attended for routine dating scans during the same time scale. The presence or absence of an intrauterine hematoma, MSAFP, and pregnancy outcomes were recorded.
RESULTS: The incidence of adverse pregnancy outcome was significantly (P = .02) higher in women with a history of first-trimester threatened miscarriage than in the control group. The relative risk (RR) of an adverse pregnancy outcome for the study group was 2.22 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.12,439) compared with the control group. The RR of delivering a baby of less than 1000 g was 4.43 (95\% CI 0.5, 39.2) in women with first-trimester threatened miscarriage. This was independent of the presence of an intrauterine hematoma. The RR of MSAFP being raised to more than 2.5 multiples of die median (MoM) in the study group was 6.25 (95\% CI 0.77, 50.6). There was no difference between women with threatened miscarriage who had or did not have ultrasound evidence of an intrauterine hematoma.
CONCLUSION: Threatened miscarriage in the first trimester is associated with an increased incidence of adverse pregnancy outcome, independently of the presence of an intrauterine hematoma. Higher MSAFP in threatened miscarriage suggests a direct placental injury even in the absence of a hematoma. (C) 2003 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.},

STUDY DESIGN: A large prospective multicenter database was studied. Subjects were divided into three groups: (1) no bleeding, (2) light bleeding, and (3) heavy bleeding. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used. RESULTS: The study comprised 16,506 patients: 14,160 patients without bleeding, 2094 patients with light bleeding, and 252 patients with heavy bleeding. Patients with vaginal bleeding, light or heavy, were more likely to experience a spontaneous loss before 24 weeks of gestation (odds ratio, 2.5 and 4.2, respectively) and cesarean delivery (odds ratio, 1.1 and 1.4, respectively). Light bleeding subjects were more likely to have preeclampsia (odds ratio, 1.5), preterm delivery (odds ratio, 1.3), and placental abruption (odds ratio, 1.6). Heavy vaginal bleeding subjects were more likely to have intrauterine growth restriction (odds ratio, 2.6), preterm delivery (odds ratio, 3.0), preterm premature rupture of membranes (odds ratio, 3.2), and placental abruption (odds ratio, 3.6).

RESULTS: The first-trimester miscarriage rate, after confirmation of viability in the threatened miscarriage group, was 9.3\%.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: First-trimester bleeding is frequent in assisted reproductive technique (ART) pregnancies. It is unknown whether first-trimester bleeding, if not ending in a spontaneous abortion, negatively influences further pregnancy outcome in ART in singletons. METHODS: Data were obtained from our ART database (1993-2002), with 1432 singleton ongoing pregnancies being included in this study. The outcome measures-second-trimester and third-trimester bleeding, preterm contraction rates, pregnancy duration, birthweight, Caesarean section rates, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (P-PROM), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and perinatal mortality-were compared in the groups with and without first-trimester bleeding. RESULTS: Significantly more singleton pregnancies resulted from a vanishing twin in the group with first-trimester bleeding (8.7\%) than in the controls (4.0\%). A correlation was found between the incidence of first-trimester bleeding and the number of embryos transferred. First-trimester bleeding led to increased second-trimester [odds ratio (OR)=4.56; confidence interval (CI)=2.76-7.56] and third-trimester bleeding rates (OR=2.85; CI=1.42-5.73), P-PROM (OR=2.44; CI=1.38-4.31), preterm contractions (OR=2.27; CI=1.48-3.47) and NICU admissions (OR=1.75; CI=1.21-2.54). First-trimester bleeding increased the risk for preterm birth (OR=1.64; CI=1.05-2.55) and extreme preterm birth (OR=3.05; CI=1.12-8.31). CONCLUSIONS: First-trimester bleeding in an ongoing singleton pregnancy following ART increases the risk for pregnancy complications. The association between first-trimester bleeding, the number of embryos transferred and adverse pregnancy outcome provides a further argument in favour of single-embryo transfer.},

CONCLUSIONS Data from our literature review indicate, by finding significant associations, that specific early pregnancy events and complications are predictors for subsequent adverse obstetric and perinatal outcome. Though, some of these associations are based on limited or small uncontrolled studies. Larger population-based controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings. Nevertheless, identification of these risks will improve obstetric care.},

RESULTS: Of 35,125 singleton deliveries in the second pregnancy, 5777 (16.4\%) were of patients with an initial miscarriage. Multivariable analysis showed a significant association between a previous miscarriage and the following adverse pregnancy outcomes including premature rupture of membranes (odds ratio [OR], 2.22; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.01-2.44), preterm delivery (OR, 1.34; 95\% CI, 1.21-1.48), intrauterine growth restriction (OR, 1.24; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.47), hypertensive disorders (OR 1.41; 95\% CI 1.07-1.85), preeclampsia (OR, 1.63; 95\% CI, 1.22-2.18), and cesarean delivery (OR, 1.59; 95\% CI, 1.46-1.73).

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of threatened miscarriage on early and late pregnancy outcome. METHODS: A retrospective case-controlled study was performed on 89 women with threatened miscarriage (study group) at Maternity and Children Hospital Buraidah, KSA from January 2010 to December 2010. They were matched for age and parity to 45 cases (control group) attending route antenatal clinic at the same time. Data recorded included, demographic characteristics and detailed pregnancy outcome and ultrasound finding including gestational age, cardiac activity and subchorionic hematoma. RESULTS: The overall adverse pregnancy outcome was significantly higher in the studied cases compared to the control group (p=015).The miscarriage rate was significantly higher in study group compared to the controls group, (16.9\%vs 2.2\%, p=0000). Preterm delivery, babies with low birth weight and premature rupture of membranes were significantly higher in the miscarriage group compared to the controls group, (15.7\% vs 2.2\%, p=0.001), (15.7\% vs 2.2\%), p=0.001) and (6.7\%) vs 4.45), p=0.016).

	abstract = {PURPOSE: First trimester vaginal bleeding (FTVB) does not usually terminate the pregnancy. However, its outcome is a matter of debate. This study sought to assess the outcomes of pregnancies, complicated by FTVB. METHODS: In this cohort study, 236 gravida 1 and 2 FTVB patients with delivery after 28 weeks of gestational age, admitted to Imam Hossein Hospital during 2009-2010, were evaluated. The control group consisted of 944 gravida 1 and 2 women without any history of vaginal bleeding. Late pregnancy outcomes such as gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, placental abruption, preterm delivery, and premature rupture of membranes in the mothers and low birth weight (LBW), intrauterine growth restriction(IUGR), Apgar score at 5 min {\textless}7, and NICU admission in the infants were evaluated. Logistic regression was used for estimation of odds ratios (OR) and 95 \% confidence interval. RESULTS: Compared to controls, the FTVB cases had more premature rupture of membranes (OR = 10), gestational hypertension (OR = 5.3), and placental abruption (OR = 4.7), while their infants had higher odds of LBW, IUGR, Apgar score at 5 min {\textless}7, and admission to NICU too. The incidence of premature rupture of membranes was 3.6 \% in the controls and 27.1 \% in the cases (RR = 10, P {\textless} 0.001). The incidence of gestational hypertension and LBW was 1.5 and 7.2 \% (P {\textless} 0.001) in the controls and 6.6 and 12.3 \% (P {\textless} 0.001) in the cases. The other outcomes were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: FTVB may play a role in the development of late pregnancy outcomes in mothers and infants. Thus, it is recommended to evaluate some interventions on FTVB cases to prevent complications.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We aimed to find out the effect of abortus imminens (AI) on obstetric outcomes of pregnancies which continued beyond the 24th week of gestation. METHODS: In this prospective study, 309 patients with AI were divided into high-risk group (with a risk factor for spontaneous abortus) (n = 92) and low-risk group (without a risk factor) (n = 217). The control group (n = 308) was chosen randomly. RESULTS: In AI group, preterm delivery, preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), cesarean section (C/S) delivery, postpartum uterine atony and need of a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) rates were significantly higher than control group. Gestational diabetes mellitus, PPROM, still birth, low APGAR scores were seen more frequently in the high-risk patients than in the control group. Furthermore in the high-risk group, preterm delivery, malpresentation, C/S delivery and need of NICU were increased much more than in the low-risk group. Gestational hypertension/preeclampsia, oligo/polyhydramniosis, intrauterine growth retardation, placenta previa, abruption of placenta, chorioamnionitis, congenital abnormalities, delivery induction, cephalopelvic disproportion, fetal distress and manual removal of placenta were not different among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AI history, especially with high-risk factors can have adverse obstetric and neonatal results. So their antenatal follow-up has to be done cautiously for the early signs and symptoms of these complications.},

	doi = {10.1093/humrep/dev044},
	abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Is a history of three or more miscarriages associated with adverse perinatal outcomes in a subsequent pregnancy? SUMMARY ANSWER: Recurrent miscarriage is associated with an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth, very preterm birth and perinatal death, in a subsequent pregnancy. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Published data are conflicting with some studies reporting an increase in adverse perinatal outcomes in association with prior recurrent miscarriage while others report little or no increase. Large-scale population-based studies have been lacking. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 30 053 women with a singleton pregnancy who booked for antenatal care and delivery between January 2008 and July 2011. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: All women who attended a university affiliated hospital in Ireland had a detailed obstetric history taken, recording the outcome of all previous pregnancies. We compared the obstetric and perinatal outcomes of 2030 women (6.8\%) who had a history of three or more miscarriages (recurrent miscarriage) with the outcomes of 28 023 women (93.2\%) who did not. Logistic regression analyses were performed, adjusting for potential confounding factors. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Women with a history of recurrent miscarriage were more likely to be obese, to have undergone assisted conception, to have had a previous perinatal death, and to be delivered by scheduled Caesarean section. Recurrent miscarriage was associated with an increased incidence of preterm birth ({\textless}37 weeks gestation, 8.1 versus 5.5\%, adjOR 1.54; 95\% CI 1.29-1.84), very preterm birth ({\textless}32 weeks gestation, 2.2 versus 1.2\%, adjOR 1.80; 95\% CI 1.28-2.53), and perinatal death (1.2 versus 0.5\%, adjOR 2.66; 95\% CI 1.70-4.14). The results were similar for both primary and secondary recurrent miscarriage. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This is a retrospective cohort study and while regression analyses adjusted for potential confounding factors, residual confounding may persist. The strict definition of recurrent miscarriage is three consecutive miscarriages and while each woman in the study group had three or more miscarriages, they were only confirmed to be consecutive in the primary RM group. The affected women have not been categorized according to aetiology of recurrent miscarriage and it may be that adverse outcomes differ according to aetiological subgroup. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study highlights the need for specialist obstetric care for women who have had three or more previous miscarriages, particularly in relation to the risk of preterm delivery. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: There was no specific funding obtained for this study and there are no conflict of interests.},

METHODS: In this case-control study, hospital records of 12,050 first-trimester patients between January 2011 and December 2012 at the Research and Educational Hospital in Ankara, Turkey, were used. Of the 12,050 patients, 481 threatened miscarriage patients were evaluated. The control group was formed by age- and body mass index-matched cases without first trimester bleeding. Abortion, intrauterine foetal demise, preterm birth, preeclampsia, antenatal haematoma, uterine atony placental abruption and low birth-weights were compared between the study and the control group. RESULTS: When compared with the control group, the risk of having a preterm birth (p = 0.014; OR: 1.95; 95\% CI: 1.15-3.24), low-birth-weight infant (p = 0.001; OR: 2.33; 95\% CI: 1.45-3.83) and abortion (p = 0.00; OR: 2.55; 95\% CI: 1.62-3.91) increased in cases of threatened miscarriage. However, the risk of uterine atony was decreased (p = 0.006; OR: 0.09; 95\% CI: 0.12-0.7) in the threatened miscarriage group when compared with the control group. Threatened miscarriage did not increase the risk of placenta praevia, placental abruption or intrauterine foetal demise. CONCLUSION: Increased complications after threatened miscarriage is probably due to the persistence of a triggering mechanism. As preterm birth and abortion rate increased, whilst uterine atony rate decreased, one of the mechanisms causing threatened miscarriage might be increased uterine contractility.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify adverse neonatal outcomes and identifies the predictors of adverse neonatal outcomes in premature rupture of membranes before 26 weeks. METHODS: Data were collected between January 2005 and December 2011 from all pregnant women who presented preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) between 18 and 26 complete weeks of gestation and were admitted to one of three Brazilian institutes. The adverse outcomes included mortality or the development of a severe morbidity during the length of stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The descriptive statistics of the population were reported. A multiple logistic regression was performed for each predictor of neonatal adverse outcomes. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curves for the birth weight was calculated. RESULTS: Composite adverse outcomes during the NICU stay occurred in 82.1\% (n = 23) of the cases and included 33 (54\%) neonatal deaths, 19 (67.8\%) cases of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), 13 (46.4\%) cases of pulmonary hypoplasia (BPD), 8 (28.5\%) cases of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PIH) and 3 (10.7\%) cases of periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). Only 17.8\% (n = 5) of the neonates survived without morbidity. The area under the curve for the birth weight was 0.90 (95\% IC: 0.81-0.98) for the prediction of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: PPROM before 26 weeks has a high morbidity and mortality, and the significant predictors of neonatal mortality and adverse outcomes were antibiotic prophylaxis, latency period, GA at birth and birth weight. Nevertheless, the only independent significant predictor of survival rate was birth weight.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Danish Medical Birth Registry (MBR) was established in 1968 and has been computerized since 1973. The primary purpose of the registration is to monitor the health of the newborns and of the quality of the antenatal and delivery care services, but the registry is increasingly being used in research. Major changes in registration have taken place in 1978 and 1991. The paper describes the content and usage of the MBR over time and suggests research topics for the future. RESULTS: A broad scope of studies illustrates how the MBR has been used, either as single data source, linked with data from other registries or with data from interviews or self-completed questionnaires. Validations have shown variations in the quality of data, depending on source, and have underlined the need for constant quality control. Any access to data at the individual level is subjected to special provisions laid down by the Data Surveillance Authority and also requires a permission from the National Board of Health. CONCLUSIONS: The time from conception to early childhood is an important period concerning future health for the individual. The Danish Medical Birth Registry is a valuable tool in this respect, which has not yet been used to its full potential in research or monitoring. Experience indicates that the quality of the registry depends upon having a close link to the staff responsible for delivery services and thus having the necessary specialised skills and interest.},

METHODS: An observational cohort study was performed on 81 pregnant women. Subjects were divided into two groups: 1) no bleeding; 2) threatened miscarriage. Patients were followed up until delivery and each materno-fetal complication was registered. RESULTS: Threatened miscarriage was associated with increased risk of preterm delivery, placenta previa, pregnancy induced hypertension/preeclampsia (PE), low birth weight (LBW) and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission. There were no significantly differences between the 2 groups with regard to preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM), CESAREAN section, retained placenta, perinatal death and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). About immediate neonatal outcomes, mean birth weights were lower ( approximately 200 g) in the study group (group 2), while no significant difference in the APGAR score between the two groups was noted. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that threatened miscarriage in the first trimester is correlated with an increased incidence of late-pregnancy and perinatal complications and, therefore, these pregnancies should be considered as high risk ones.},

RESULTS: Consistent with previous studies, previous miscarriage was associated with an increased risk of all-cause preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio, aOR 1.26; 95\% confidence interval, 95\% CI 1.22-1.29). This arose from associations with all subtypes. The strongest association was found with extreme preterm birth (aOR 1.73; 95\% CI 1.57-1.90). Risk increased with the number of miscarriages. Women with three or more miscarriages had the greatest risk of all-cause preterm birth (aOR 2.14; 95\% CI 1.93-2.38), and the strongest association was with extreme preterm birth (aOR 3.87; 95\% CI 2.85-5.26). The strength of the association between miscarriage and preterm birth decreased from 1980 to 2008. This was because of weakening associations with spontaneous preterm birth and induced preterm birth without a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. CONCLUSIONS: The association between a prior history of miscarriage and the risk of preterm birth declined in Scotland over the period 1980-2008. We speculate that changes in the methods of managing incomplete termination of pregnancy might explain the trend, through reduced cervical damage.},

In this review, we discuss a variety of methods that are increasingly being used in observational epidemiological studies to help strengthen causal inference. These methods include negative controls, cross-contextual designs, instrumental variables (including Mendelian randomization), family-based studies, and natural experiments. Applications within the DOHaD framework, and in relation to behavioral, psychiatric, and psychological domains, are considered, and the considerable potential for expanding the use of these methods is outlined.},

Moreover, insights from pregnancy cohorts also unveiled a collateral effect of pregnancy on maternal immunity, mirrored by an ameliorated course of certain autoimmune diseases, but also an increased risk of infection with influenza A virus. Future pregnancy cohort studies are still required to close gaps in knowledge on how parameters involved in the developmental origin of health or poor immunity observed in children later in life are operational.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the occurrence of spontaneous abortion, comparing two different data sources. To estimate the rate of spontaneous abortion over a 2-year period, and examine potential predictors of the risk for incident spontaneous abortion. METHODS: We used interview data from a population-based prospective cohort study comprising 11,088 women and data from a linkage of the cohort with the Hospital Discharge Register to compare spontaneous abortions as reported in the interview with those identified in the register. Based on interview data, we estimated the rate of spontaneous abortion during the two-year follow-up. Finally, risk determinants for incident spontaneous abortion were analyzed by means of logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 654 spontaneous abortions before enrolment in the study were reported by the women compared to 531 abortions found in the register. More than 80\% of the spontaneous abortions identified from both sources were recorded in the same year. During follow-up a total of 20.9\% of pregnancies intended to be carried to term ended as a spontaneous abortion. In the risk factor analysis, we found that previous spontaneous abortion, being single, never having used oral contraceptives, and use of intrauterine device were associated with increased risk of subsequent spontaneous abortion. In addition, it was indicated that a short interpregnancy interval following a spontaneous abortion may confer an increased risk of abortion in the subsequent pregnancy. CONCLUSION: We found a high rate of spontaneous abortion in the present study and an acceptable agreement between information obtained by interview and register information. More than 25\% of the spontaneous abortions were only reported by the women, and this could not be explained by erroneously reported induced abortions, and may be early, nonhospitalized abortions. We confirm that number of previous spontaneous abortions is a strong determinant, and our data may also indicate a role of previous contraceptive habits. A role of the length of interpregnancy interval in the risk of spontaneous abortion cannot be ruled out.},

DESIGN AND SETTING: Population based cohort study and a case-control study, both based on data from a prescription registry, the Danish birth registry, and one county's hospital discharge registry. PARTICIPANTS: COHORT STUDY: 1462 pregnant women who had taken up prescriptions for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the period from 30 days before conception to birth and 17 259 pregnant women who were not prescribed any drugs during pregnancy. CASE-CONTROL STUDY: 4268 women who had miscarriages, of whom 63 had taken non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and 29 750 primiparous controls who had live births. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidences of congenital abnormality, low birth weight, preterm birth, and miscarriage. RESULTS: Odds ratios for congenital abnormality, low birth weight, and preterm birth among women who took up prescriptions for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were 1.27 (95\% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.75), 0.79 (0.45 to 1.38), and 1.05 (0.80 to 1.39) respectively. Odds ratios for the taking up of prescriptions in the weeks before miscarriage ranged from 6.99 (2.75 to 17.74) when prescriptions were taken up during the last week before the miscarriage to 2.69 (1.81 to 4.00) when taken up between 7 and 9 weeks before. The risk estimates were no different when the analysis was restricted to missed abortions. CONCLUSIONS: Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during pregnancy does not seem to increase the risk of adverse birth outcome but is associated with increased risk of miscarriage.},

	abstract = {Importance: Body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain are increasing globally. In 2009, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) provided specific recommendations regarding the ideal gestational weight gain. However, the association between gestational weight gain consistent with theIOM guidelines and pregnancy outcomes is unclear. Objective: To perform a systematic review, meta-analysis, and metaregression to evaluate associations between gestational weight gain above or below the IOM guidelines (gain of 12.5-18 kg for underweight women [BMI {\textless}18.5]; 11.5-16 kg for normal-weight women [BMI 18.5-24.9]; 7-11 kg for overweight women [BMI 25-29.9]; and 5-9 kg for obese women [BMI {\textgreater}/=30]) and maternal and infant outcomes. Data Sources and Study Selection: Search of EMBASE, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, MEDLINE, and MEDLINE In-Process between January 1, 1999, and February 7, 2017, for observational studies stratified by prepregnancy BMI category and total gestational weight gain. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers. Odds ratios (ORs) and absolute risk differences (ARDs) per live birth were calculated using a random-effects model based on a subset of studies with available data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were small for gestational age (SGA), preterm birth, and large for gestational age (LGA). Secondary outcomes were macrosomia, cesarean delivery, and gestational diabetes mellitus. Results: Of 5354 identified studies, 23 (n = 1309136 women) met inclusion criteria. Gestational weight gain was below or above guidelines in 23\% and 47\% of pregnancies, respectively. Gestational weight gain below the recommendations was associated with higher risk of SGA (OR, 1.53 [95\% CI, 1.44-1.64]; ARD, 5\% [95\% CI, 4\%-6\%]) and preterm birth (OR, 1.70 [1.32-2.20]; ARD, 5\% [3\%-8\%]) and lower risk of LGA (OR, 0.59 [0.55-0.64]; ARD, -2\% [-10\% to -6\%]) and macrosomia (OR, 0.60 [0.52-0.68]; ARD, -2\% [-3\% to -1\%]); cesarean delivery showed no significant difference (OR, 0.98 [0.96-1.02]; ARD, 0\% [-2\% to 1\%]). Gestational weight gain above the recommendations was associated with lower risk of SGA (OR, 0.66 [0.63-0.69]; ARD, -3\%; [-4\% to -2\%]) and preterm birth (OR, 0.77 [0.69-0.86]; ARD, -2\% [-2\% to -1\%]) and higher risk of LGA (OR, 1.85 [1.76-1.95]; ARD, 4\% [2\%-5\%]), macrosomia (OR, 1.95 [1.79-2.11]; ARD, 6\% [4\%-9\%]), and cesarean delivery (OR, 1.30 [1.25-1.35]; ARD, 4\% [3\%-6\%]). Gestational diabetes mellitus could not be evaluated because of the nature of available data. Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review and meta-analysis of more than 1 million pregnant women, 47\% had gestational weight gain greater than IOM recommendations and 23\% had gestational weight gain less than IOM recommendations. Gestational weight gain greater than or less than guideline recommendations, compared with weight gain within recommended levels, was associated with higher risk of adverse maternal and infant outcomes.},

We aimed to estimate the proportion of all fetuses with birth defects terminated in the second trimester of pregnancy-overall and for specific defects. METHODS: The study comprised all pregnancies ending in a singleton birth, miscarriage, or termination of pregnancy for which health care services were sought, as recorded in Danish medical registries between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2011. RESULTS: Of the 420,090 pregnancies, 307,637 fetuses survived until gestational week 12 or beyond; of these, 296,373 (96\%) ended in a live birth or stillbirth and 11,264 (4\%) ended in a second-trimester termination. The prevalence of birth defects among live births and stillbirths was 3\% (9,790/296,373); the corresponding prevalence among second-trimester-terminated pregnancies was 14\% (1,563/11,264). Although only 4\% of all pregnancies ended in a second-trimester termination, 14\% (1,563/11,353) of pregnancies with birth defects were ended by a second-trimester termination. The groups of birth defects with the highest proportion of second-trimester terminations were defects of the nervous system (347/740; 48\%) and abdominal wall (58/149; 39\%). For many types of birth defects, however, that proportion was less than 10\%. CONCLUSION: The proportion of terminated pregnancies carrying birth defects is considerably greater than the corresponding proportion for pregnancies that end as live births or stillbirths. The proportion of birth defects unobserved at birth due to second-trimester terminations depends on type of defect and lethality.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that prenatal stress contributes to the risk of obesity later in life. In a population-based cohort study, we examined whether prenatal stress related to maternal bereavement during pregnancy was associated with the risk of overweight in offspring during school age. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We followed 65,212 children born in Denmark from 1970-1989 who underwent health examinations from 7 to 13 years of age in public or private schools in Copenhagen. We identified 459 children as exposed to prenatal stress, defined by being born to mothers who were bereaved by death of a close family member from one year before pregnancy until birth of the child. We compared the prevalence of overweight between the exposed and the unexposed. Body mass index (BMI) values and prevalence of overweight were higher in the exposed children, but not significantly so until from 10 years of age and onwards, as compared with the unexposed children. For example, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for overweight was 1.68 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-2.61) at 12 years of age and 1.63 (95\% CI 1.00-2.61) at 13 years of age. The highest ORs were observed when the death occurred in the period from 6 to 0 month before pregnancy (OR 3.31, 95\% CI 1.71-6.42 at age 12, and OR 2.31, 95\% CI 1.08-4.97 at age 13).

	abstract = {Denmark has an extensive collection of national and regional medical registries. There are many advantages to registry-based research when investigating genetic diseases which, due to their rarity, can be difficult to identify. In this study, we aimed to provide an updated overview of Danish registries for medical genetic conditions and describe how data linkage across registries can be used to collect data on genetic diseases at the individual level and at the family level. We present a list of medical genetic registries in Denmark at the national level, data sources from the departments of clinical genetics and other specialized centers, and project-specific data sources. We also summarize key general registries, such as the Danish National Registry of Patients, the Danish Medical Birth Registry, and the Civil Registration System, which are renowned for their comprehensive and high quality data, and are useful supplemental data sources for genetic epidemiology research. We describe the potential for data linkage across multiple registries, which allows for access to medical histories with follow-up time spanning birth to death. Finally, we provide a brief introduction to the Danish epidemiological research setting and legalities related to data access. The Danish collection of medical registries is a valuable resource for genetic epidemiology research.},

METHODS: In a nationwide cohort of patients with incident T2D (n = 155 158) and an age-, gender-, and residence-matched comparison cohort (n = 774 017), we used Cox regression to compute rates and confounder-adjusted rate ratios (aRRs) of community-based antibiotic prescription redemption and hospital-treated infections during 2004-2012. RESULTS: The rates of community-based antibiotic prescriptions in the T2D and comparison cohorts were 364 vs 275 per 1000 person-years after a median follow-up of 1.1 years (aRR = 1.24; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.23 to 1.25). The corresponding rates for hospital-treated infection were 58 vs 39 per 1000 person-years after a median follow-up of 2.8 years (aRR = 1.49; 95\% CI, 1.47 to 1.52). The aRRs were increased particularly for urinary tract infections (UTIs, 1.41; 95\% CI, 1.35 to 1.45), skin infections (1.50; 95\% CI, 1.45 to 1.55), septicemia (1.60; 95\% CI, 1.53 to 1.67), and tuberculosis (1.61; 95\% CI, 1.25 to 2.06) and of community-based antibiotics prescribed for UTIs (1.31; 95\% CI, 1.29 to 1.33), Staphylococcus aureus infections (1.32; 95\% CI, 1.30 to 1.34), and mycobacterial infections (1.69; 95\% CI, 1.36 to 2.09). The 1-year aRR declined from 1.89 (95\% CI, 1.75 to 2.04) in 2004 to 1.59 (95\% CI, 1.45 to 1.74) in 2011 for hospital-treated infection (trend P = .007) and from 1.31 (95\% CI, 1.27 to 1.36) in 2004 to 1.26 (95\% CI, 1.22 to 1.30) in 2011 for community-based antibiotic prescriptions (trend P = .006).

PARTICIPANTS: 6120 female Danish residents, aged 21-45 years, in a stable relationship with a male partner, who were trying to conceive and not receiving fertility treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Alcohol consumption was self reported as beer (330 mL bottles), red or white wine (120 mL glasses), dessert wine (50 mL glasses), and spirits (20 mL) and categorized in standard servings per week (none, 1-3, 4-7, 8-13, and {\textgreater}/=14). Participants contributed menstrual cycles at risk until the report of pregnancy, start of fertility treatment, loss to follow-up, or end of observation (maximum 12 menstrual cycles). A proportional probability regression model was used to estimate fecundability ratios (cycle specific probability of conception among exposed women divided by that among unexposed women). RESULTS: 4210 (69\%) participants achieved a pregnancy during follow-up. Median alcohol intake was 2.0 (interquartile range 0-3.5) servings per week. Compared with no alcohol consumption, the adjusted fecundability ratios for alcohol consumption of 1-3, 4-7, 8-13, and 14 or more servings per week were 0.97 (95\% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.03), 1.01 (0.93 to 1.10), 1.01 (0.87 to 1.16) and 0.82 (0.60 to 1.12), respectively. Compared with no alcohol intake, the adjusted fecundability ratios for women who consumed only wine ({\textgreater}/=3 servings), beer ({\textgreater}/=3 servings), or spirits ({\textgreater}/=2 servings) were 1.05 (0.91 to1.21), 0.92 (0.65 to 1.29), and 0.85 (0.61 to 1.17), respectively. The data did not distinguish between regular and binge drinking, which may be important if large amounts of alcohol are consumed during the fertile window. CONCLUSION: Consumption of less than 14 servings of alcohol per week seemed to have no discernible effect on fertility. No appreciable difference in fecundability was observed by level of consumption of beer and wine.},

DESIGN: Prospective study with elements of retrospective data collection. SETTING: Denmark 1996-2002. POPULATION: A total of 92,671 pregnant women enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort and interviewed subsequently. METHODS: Data on exercise during pregnancy and potential confounders were obtained through computer-assisted telephone interviews either during pregnancy or after an early miscarriage. Outcome of pregnancy was identified by register linkage. Using Cox regression analysis, we estimated the hazard ratio (HR) of miscarriage according to weekly amount of exercise and the type of exercise. The HR was estimated for {\textless}11, 11-14, 15-18, and 19-22 weeks of gestation, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Miscarriage, defined as fetal loss before 22 completed weeks of gestation. RESULTS: A stepwise increasing relation was found between amount of exercise and risk of miscarriage, where risk of miscarriage increased by amount of exercise up to HR = 3.7 (95\% CI 2.9-4.7) for women who exercised more than 7 hours per week compared with nonexercisers. Particularly 'high-impact exercise' was associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. No association was seen between exercise and risk of miscarriage after 18 weeks of gestation. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that exercise early in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. The results should, however, be interpreted cautiously as potential bias arising from retrospective data collection may explain part of the association.},

Internationally, there is a lack of knowledge about how ethical matters are considered in Nordic registry-based research, and a lack of knowledge about how Nordic ethics committees operate and what is needed to obtain an approval. In this paper, we review ethical aspects of registry-based research, the legal framework, the role of ethics review boards in the Nordic countries, and the structure of the ethics application. We discuss the role of informed consent in registry-based research and how to safeguard the integrity of study participants, including vulnerable subjects and children. Our review also provides information on the different government agencies that contribute registry-based data, and a list of the major health registries in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. Both ethical values and conditions for registry-based research are similar in the Nordic countries. While Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden have chosen different legal frameworks, these differences can be resolved through mutual recognition of ethical applications and by harmonizing the different systems, likely leading to increased collaboration and enlarged studies.},

We undertook a registry-based analysis with minimal selection bias and prospective record-based ascertainment of terminations.

Primary breast cancer cases were 25-55 years old at diagnosis between 1988 and 2000 and had a record of the diagnosis in the Massachusetts Cancer Registry. We matched 3 controls to each case on maternal age, year of giving birth and birth facility. Information on terminations (induced and spontaneous) before the birth of record, the matched factors and potential confounders were collected from the birth certificate. After adjustment for the matched factors, age, parity and maternal and paternal education, the odds ratio associating any termination history with breast cancer risk equaled 0.91 (95\% CI = 0.79-1.05). The marginally protective adjusted odds ratio largely derived from a protective effect among women with parity equaled to 1 (OR for any termination = 0.68; 95\% CI = 0.45-1.03), suggesting a protective effect of terminated pregnancy among women with one live birth.},

	volume = {62},
	issn = {2245-1919 (Electronic) 2245-1919 (Linking)},
	abstract = {Psychological stress at work is a rising problem in Denmark. Nearly one third of the women reported in 2005 that they had difficulties completing their work tasks, and 17 \% found that they had only limited or no influence on their work tasks. The corresponding numbers for 1987 were 18.3 \% and 16 \%, respectively. Work-related stress shortens the life expectancy and reduces the number of years without prolonged disease. For the society work-related stress amounts to more than 30,000 hospital admissions each year, half a million extra days on sick-leave for women, 500,000 contacts to general practitioners, 1600 early retirements for women, and an overuse of the health-care system. With the second highest employment rate in Europe for women - and many of them in the childbearing age - effects of psychological stress at work may extend beyond the exposed individual and affect pregnancy, birth and health of the child. Few studies on job stress relative to pregnancy have been carried out, but both animal and epidemiological studies have shown effect of exposure to stressful conditions during pregnancy and adverse effects on the offspring. The specific aims for the three studies included in this thesis were to investigate the association between maternal psychosocial job strain during pregnancy, measured as high demands and low control and the risk of: - Having a child born preterm or with low or high birth weight relative to gestational week (paper I + II) - Congenital malformations in offspring (paper III) - Asthma and atopic dermatitis in the children (paper IV). Furthermore, it was also the ambition to maximize and secure the quality of research and integrity of the data used by documenting the methods in a protocol that described the analyses before they were done and to keep transparency in the methods used following good epidemiological practices (GEP) for occupational and environmental epidemiological research. All analyses in this thesis are based on information and data from the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC). The cohort was established in 1994 and baseline information from the enrolled 100,418 pregnancies was gathered from 1996 to 2002. At their first antenatal visit pregnant women were invited to participate in the cohort by their general practitioner. To contribute the women had to be pregnant, have intentions of carrying the pregnancy to term, reside in Denmark and speak Danish sufficiently well to participate in telephone interviews. When enrolled the women were asked to participate in two telephone interviews during pregnancy at approximately 12-14 and 30-32 weeks of gestation and two after birth when the child was six and 18 months old and a follow-up questionnaire at age seven years. Exposure to work-related stress was assessed based on information from the first interview on two questions regarding job control and job demands. These questions were interpreted as dimensions of demands and control, and hereafter used as a proxy for the dimensions of the job strain model by Karasek. Based on their answers, the women were divided into the four job strain categories: high strain, active, passive and low strain. Gestational age at birth, birthweight and congenital malformations were extracted from the Danish Medical Birth Register. The outcome variable on asthma and atopic dermatitis were based on maternal self-reports from the fourth (child 18 months) and fifth (child seven years old) interviews/questionnaires. All studies in the thesis were based on protocols describing methods, analyses etc. prior to handling. No associations were found between exposure to high strain (high demands, low control) during pregnancy and preterm birth, small for gestational age, congenital malformations and asthma in the children when compared to women exposed to low strain (low demands, high control). A protective effect on large for gestational age was observed when exposed to high strain, suggesting an impact on the birthweight although it was not seen among the small for gestational age children. An association between high strain exposure and ever atopic dermatitis in seven-year-old children was observed, with 15\% higher odds of atopic dermatitis when compared to women exposed to low strain during their pregnancy. The effects of high strain found were modest, but even modest effects might be relevant with high prevalence as with atopic dermatitis (lifetime prevalence of 15-20\%). The studies included in this thesis add to the rather limited knowledge of prenatal exposure to work-related stress end health implications for the child. In the Danish work environment recommendations for women being pregnant or breastfeeding work-related stress is only mentioned very briefly. Findings from this thesis do not support rewriting in regards to risk of preterm birth, low birth weight or malformations. Results did show effects in regards to allergic diseases, but as the study is the only one of its kind, other studies are needed to replicate the findings if to reconsider the recommendations for pregnant women. Future research could benefit of validation of the use of two single-item measures of job strain compared to fully validated multi-item instruments. A shift toward more "functional endpoints" as overweight and cognitive behavioural disorders in the children could be of relevance.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: History of fetal loss including miscarriage and stillbirth has been inconsistently associated with childhood (0-14 years) leukemia in subsequent offspring. A quantitative synthesis of the inconclusive literature by leukemia subtype was therefore conducted. METHODS: Eligible studies (N = 32) were identified through the screening of over 3500 publications. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted on the association of miscarriage/stillbirth history with overall (AL; 18,868 cases/35,685 controls), acute lymphoblastic (ALL; 16,150 cases/38,655 controls), and myeloid (AML; 3042 cases/32,997 controls) leukemia. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses by age and ALL subtype, as well as meta-regression were undertaken. RESULTS: Fetal loss history was associated with increased AL risk [Odds Ratio (OR) 1.10, 95\% Confidence Intervals (CI) 1.04-1.18]. The positive association was seen for ALL (OR 1.12, 95\%CI 1.05-1.19) and for AML (OR 1.13, 95\%CI 0.91-1.41); for the latter the OR increased in sensitivity analyses. Notably, stillbirth history was significantly linked to ALL risk (OR 1.33, 95\%CI 1.02-1.74), but not AML. By contrast, the association of ALL and AML with previous miscarriage reached marginal significance. The association of miscarriage history was strongest in infant ALL (OR 2.34, 95\%CI 1.19-4.60). CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis involving {\textgreater}50,000 children, we found noteworthy associations by indices of fetal loss, age at diagnosis, and leukemia type; namely, of stillbirth with ALL and miscarriage history with infant ALL. Elucidation of plausible underlying mechanisms may provide insight into leukemia pathogenesis and indicate monitoring interventions prior to and during pregnancy.},

OBJECTIVES: To determine the potential of using antenatal serum levels of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFlt1) and placental growth factor (PlGF) at 20-28weeks of gestation for prediction of subsequent preeclampsia in non-selected population. METHODS: A reference range of serum sFlt1, PlGF level and sFlt1/PlGF ratio at 10-42weeks of gestation was determined from 291 healthy pregnant women using automated assays. Through antenatal visits at 20-28weeks of gestation, serum of 1,689 women who had singleton pregnancy were obtained and frozen at -80 degrees C. Serum of the mothers who subsequently develop preeclampsia were thawed and analyzed for sFlt1 and PlGF levels. RESULTS: At 48 hours postpartum, 21 of 1,689 mothers developed preeclampsia. Serum levels (mean+/-SEM) of sFlt1, PlGF and sFlt1/PlGF ratio obtained at 20-23(+6)weeks of gestation in preeclampsia (N=8) Vs. normal values were 1,845+/-697 Vs. 1807+/-95pg/ml, 339+/-86 Vs. 542+/-26pg/ml and 33.9+/-29.5 Vs. 4.1+/-0.3 (P = 0.304,0.051 and 0.561) respectively.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine the association between pregravid oral contraceptive (OC) use and spontaneous abortion (SAB). METHODS: In an Internet-based preconception cohort study of 4862 Danish pregnancy planners, we used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between OC use and SAB. We controlled for maternal age, physical activity, parity, education, alcohol and caffeine consumption, body mass index, and smoking. RESULTS: Compared with women who discontinued OCs {\textgreater}1 year before conception, HRs were 0.95 (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.77-1.17), 0.99 (95\% CI = 0.82-1.19), and 0.80 (95\% CI = 0.60-1.06) for women who discontinued OCs 7-12, 2-6, and 0-1 months before conception, respectively. Compared with less than 4 years of OC use, HRs for 4-7, 8-11, and 12 years or more of OC use were 1.05 (95\% CI = 0.80-1.37), 0.92 (95\% CI = 0.71-1.19), and 0.88 (95\% CI = 0.65-1.19), respectively. Dose of estrogen and generation of progestin were not materially associated with SAB risk. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that pregravid OC use is associated with an increase in SAB. Use within 1 month of conception was associated with a slightly lower risk of SAB, but this may be due to increased reproductive fitness in women who conceive quickly after discontinuation of OCs.},

	abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Is caffeine and caffeinated beverage consumption associated with the risk of spontaneous abortion (SAB)? SUMMARY ANSWER: While preconceptional caffeine consumption was not materially associated with an increased risk of SAB, consumption during early pregnancy was associated with a small increased risk of SAB, although the relation was not linear. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Caffeine has been hypothesized as a risk factor for SAB since the 1980s; however, results from previous studies have been conflicting. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This prospective cohort study included 5132 Danish women planning pregnancy and enrolled from 2007 to 2010. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Participants were women who conceived after entry into the Snart-Gravid cohort and who were aged 18-40, in a stable relationship with a male partner, and did not use fertility treatments to conceive. Women reported their daily caffeine and caffeinated beverage consumption on questionnaires before conception and during early pregnancy. All exposure measurements were prospective with respect to outcome ascertainment. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of SAB for categories of caffeine consumption in milligrams (mg) per day and the corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) using Cox proportional hazards regression models with gestational weeks as the time scale. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: There were 732 women (14.3\%) who were identified as having a SAB. In the preconceptional period, caffeine consumption was not materially associated with SAB risk (HR comparing {\textgreater}/=300 with {\textless}100 mg/day: 1.09; 95\% CI: 0.89, 1.33). In early pregnancy, the HRs for 100-199, 200-299 and {\textgreater}/=300 mg/day of caffeine consumption were 1.62 (95\% CI: 1.19, 2.22), 1.48 (95\% CI: 1.03, 2.13) and 1.23 (95\% CI: 0.61, 2.46), respectively, compared with that for {\textless}100 mg/day. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The observed results may be affected by non-differential exposure misclassification, reverse causation and residual confounding. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This is the largest study to date of prospectively measured, preconception caffeine consumption and risk of SAB. We were able to reduce the likelihood of differential left truncation bias and recall bias present in other analyses. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: Snart-Gravid was funded by the NICHD (R21-050264). Dr. Hahn's work was funded in part by the BU Reproductive, Perinatal, and Pediatric Epidemiology Training Grant NIH \#T32HD052458. There are no competing interests.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies indicate that female obesity increases the risk of spontaneous abortion (SAB). Central adiposity, height, and location of typical weight gain have not been examined as risk factors for SAB. METHODS: We examined the associations between selected anthropometric factors and risk of SAB among 5132 women enrolled in a Danish Internet-based prospective cohort study of pregnancy planners. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models, with gestational weeks as the time scale, to compute hazard ratios (HRs) of SAB and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders, the HRs for SAB among underweight (body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2) ) {\textless}20), overweight (BMI: 25-29) and obese (BMI {\textgreater}/=30) women were 1.00 [95\% CI: 0.81, 1.24], 0.90 [95\% CI: 0.73, 1.09] and 1.23 [95\% CI: 0.98, 1.54], respectively, compared with normal weight women (BMI 20-24). The association between obesity and SAB was stronger for early SAB ({\textless}8 weeks gestation); HR: 1.34 95\% CI: 1.01, 1.77. The HR for height {\textgreater}/=174 cm vs. {\textless}166 cm was 0.81 [95\% CI: 0.66, 1.00]. Increased waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was inversely associated with risk of SAB (HR: 0.81; 95\% CI: 0.63, 1.05). Waist circumference and location of typical weight gain were not appreciably associated with SAB risk. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms previous studies that have shown a small positive association between obesity and SAB risk. Our results suggest that obesity is a stronger risk factor for early pregnancy losses, and that small stature and low WHR are associated with an increased risk of SAB.},

Furthermore, studies which have combined GI disorders or symptoms for examination as one overall category may potentially obscure associations between PTSD and individual GI diagnoses. METHODS: This nationwide cohort study examined the incidence of all major nonmalignant GI disorders in patients with a prior PTSD diagnosis (n = 4,076), compared with the general population incidence from 1995 to 2013, using Danish medical registry data. We examined differences by sex, age, marital status, psychiatric and somatic comorbidity, and follow-up time. Risks, standardized incidence rates (SIRs), and confidence intervals (95\% CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: Risk of any GI disorder among PTSD patients was 25\% (95\% CI: 21\%, 29\%); the SIR for any GI disorder was 1.8 (95\% CI: 1.7, 2.0). Risk and SIRs varied by disorder (e.g., no association with diverticula of the intestines [SIR: 1.1, 95\% CI: 0.83, 1.5]; stronger association with peptic ulcer, site unspecified [SIR: 3.3, 95\% CI: 1.8, 5.5]). Stratified analyses revealed that some associations were stronger for persons ages 16-39 or unmarried at PTSD diagnosis, persons with comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, and in the year following PTSD diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study documents associations between clinician-diagnosed PTSD and all major nonmalignant GI disorders in an unselected nationwide cohort with long follow-up. Differences in associations across GI disorders and important modifiers may account for previous conflicting research findings.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown that pregnancy loss may affect the mental health of women in subsequent pregnancies. The China Anhui Birth Defects and Child Development cohort study therefore aimed to investigate the influence of pregnancy loss on anxiety and depression in subsequent pregnancies. STUDY DESIGN: In total, 20,308 pregnant women provided written informed consent and completed the study questionnaire. The Self-rating Anxiety Scale and Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale were used to evaluate anxiety and depression in pregnant women. Pearson's chi(2) test and binary logistic regression were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Of 20,308 pregnant women, 1495 (7.36\%) had a history of miscarriage and 7686 (37.85\%) had a history of induced abortion. The binary logistic regression model found that pregnant women with a history of miscarriage had a significantly higher risk of anxiety and depression in the first trimester than primigravidae after stratified analysis according to the timing of the first prenatal visit (p{\textless}0.05). Compared with pregnant women with no history of miscarriage, women who had a history of miscarriage and an interpregnancy interval of less than 6 months had increased risk of anxiety symptoms (p{\textless}0.05) and depression symptoms (p{\textless}0.05) during the first trimester. Women with an interpregnancy interval of 7-12 months had a 2.511-fold higher risk of depression (p{\textless}0.05) than women with no history of miscarriage. These findings were not changed after adjustment for maternal age, maternal education, family income, place of residence and pre-pregnancy body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: Women with a history of miscarriage experienced significant anxiety and depression during their next pregnancy. A short interpregnancy interval and the first trimester are risk factors for adverse mental health.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that abortions leave the breast epithelium in a proliferative state with an increased susceptibility to carcinogenesis. Results from previous studies of induced or spontaneous abortions and risk of subsequent breast cancer are contradictory, probably due to methodological considerations. We investigated the relationship between abortions and subsequent breast cancer risk in a case-control study using prospectively recorded exposure information. The study population comprised women recorded in the population-based Swedish Medical Birth Register between 1973-91. Cases were defined by linkage of the birth register to the Swedish Cancer Register and controls were randomly selected from the birth register. From the subjects' antenatal care records we abstracted prospectively collected information on induced and spontaneous abortions, as well as a number of potential confounding factors. Relative risk of breast cancer was estimated by odds ratios (OR) with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI). A reduced risk of breast cancer was observed for women with a history of at least 1 compared to no abortions (adjusted OR = 0.84, 95\% CI = 0.72-0.99). The adjusted OR decreases step-wise with number of abortions to 0.59 (95\% CI = 0.34-1.03) for 3 or more compared to no abortions. The patterns are similar for induced and spontaneous abortions. In conclusion, neither a history of induced nor spontaneous abortions is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Our data suggest a protective effect of pregnancies regardless of outcome.},

This study aimed to describe the opinions of the Finnish public about these issues. METHODS: Mail survey questionnaire sent to a random sample of 1000 Finns. RESULTS: Participation proportion was 42\%, with 258 women and 160 men. The majority of the participants (61\%) were willing to provide their identifiable health information for research. Almost half of the participants (48\%) would, nevertheless, like to be informed when their information is used. A third (30\%) indicated no need for informed consent in register-based research, a similar proportion felt it should be obtained for every study, and 40\% thought it necessary in some situations, such as studies addressing a sensitive study topic. As for the best policy for obtaining consent, the majority (86\%) favoured broader consent methods: one consent covering a certain register or a research topic. Half of the participants (55\%) desired a required ethical evaluation from register-based research addressing a sensitive issue. Privacy protection was the most common concern for register-based research. More than half of the participants were either content with the current Finnish laws concerning register-based research or wanted to liberalize them to advance research. CONCLUSIONS: The Finnish public is supportive of register-based research, but the requirement for informed consent divides opinions and many would at least like to be informed of the research use of their information.},

RESULTS: A total of 1233 medical records (99\% of the total sample) were available for review. PPVs ranged from 83\% to 100\%. For examinations, the PPV was overall 98\%, reflecting PPVs of 97\% for echocardiography, 97\% for right heart catheterisation and 100\% for coronary angiogram. For procedures, the PPV was 98\% overall, with PPVs of 98\% for thrombolysis, 92\% for cardioversion, 100\% for radiofrequency ablation, 98\% for percutaneous coronary intervention, and 100\% for both cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardiac defibrillators. For cardiac surgery, the overall PPVs was 99\%, encompassing PPVs of 100\% for mitral valve surgery, 99\% for aortic valve surgery, 98\% for coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and 100\% for heart transplantation. The accuracy of coding was consistent within age, sex, and calendar year categories, and the agreement between independent reviewers was high (99\%).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pre-natal and early life factors may have a role in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis in some people. However, the reporting of any influence of maternal and perinatal factors on MS risk has been limited. We aimed to study maternal and perinatal characteristics of babies who went on to develop MS. METHODS: Data were analysed from the historical Oxford Record Linkage Study dataset 1970-1989, which incorporated a specialised maternity dataset with record linkage between mother and baby, covering a population of 850,000. Each maternal admission record, and records of her baby, were linked to any prior or subsequent recorded day-case or inpatient hospital admission episodes 1963-2011. The file of the offspring was searched for a subsequent record of MS, and the maternal and perinatal characteristics of the offspring with a record of MS were compared with those with no record of MS. RESULTS: There was a record of MS for 75 of the offspring, of whom 60 were female. MS was significantly more common in children of mothers who smoked (OR=2.1 (95\%CI 1.0-4.7). There was a tendency towards an elevated risk of MS in children of mothers of lower social classes (social class 4+5 OR=1.9 (0.9-3.9)). There were no significant associations between MS in the offspring and mothers' marital status, maternal weight, parity, pre-eclampsia, blood group, or babies' birth weight, birth weight for gestational age, mode of delivery, or presentation at delivery. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support an important role for most studied maternal and perinatal factors in influencing MS risk. The possible exceptions, speculatively because numbers of subjects with MS were small, were maternal smoking, and pre-term birth. Future work, using datasets that would yield bigger numbers of cases of MS, should explore interactions between perinatal factors that are unlikely to be acting independently.},

Neurologists and obstetricians need to have proper information to discuss with women presenting with MS who consider pregnancy. OBJECTIVES: Literature review and meta-analysis of data on pregnancy in women with MS. SEARCH STRATEGY: The present work followed the recommendations of the PRISMA Statement. Using the PICO framework, the authors independently searched for the terms 'pregnancy' OR 'gestation' OR 'pregnant' AND 'multiple sclerosis' OR 'MS' in the following databases: EMBASE/Excerpta Medica, Medline, Pubmed, Scopus, Index Medicus, Biomed Central, Ebsco Fulltext, LILACS, Scielo and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: only papers presenting original work with analysis of at least one of the outcomes among pregnant women with MS were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent workers performed the literature review. All the authors selected and read the relevant papers. Two other authors summarised data for analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-two papers reporting on 13,144 women with MS and their pregnancies were analysed. A significant decrease in relapse rate was observed during pregnancy, followed by a significant increase after delivery. Miscarriages, low birthweight, prematurity, neonatal death and malformations were assessed among these women and their offspring. There seems to be a regional influence on the rates of caesarean sections and abortions among women with MS. Neonatal death and malformation rates did not seem to be particularly high. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The present work provides evidence-based data that can be discussed with women with MS and their relatives when pregnancy is considered by these families.},

Conditional logistic regression assessed the association of maternal smoking with MS in offspring with adjustment for socioeconomic index. RESULTS: Maternal smoking during pregnancy was not associated with MS in offspring, with an odds ratio (and 95\% confidence interval) of 0.96 (0.65-1.44). When stratified by paediatric or later MS onset there was no association with maternal smoking in either stratum.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Possible associations between childbearing patterns and multiple sclerosis (MS) risk have been studied for a long time, with conflicting results. We aimed to investigate the influence of reproductive history on MS risk. METHODS: Using a Swedish population-based case-control study involving incident cases of MS (1798 cases, 3907 controls), we calculated odds ratios (OR) for MS comparing parents with childless subjects together with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) employing logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, there was an association between having children and reduced MS risk among both sexes. Subjects who had become parents within five years prior to the index year had a substantially reduced risk of developing MS (OR 0.6, 95\% CI 0.5-0.8 for women, and OR 0.4, 95\% CI 0.3-0.6 for men). No association between having children and MS risk was observed when more than 10 years had passed since the birth of the last child. We found no association between increasing offspring number and MS risk. CONCLUSIONS: The observed association between reproductive history and MS risk is restricted to a limited time period preceding the index year, with similar findings in both sexes, which contradicts biologic impact of pregnancy on MS risk and argues in favor of reverse causality, i.e. that fecundity is affected by yet-undiagnosed MS.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Vitamin D has been associated with a decreased risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) in adulthood; however, some, but not all, previous studies have suggested that in utero vitamin D exposure may be a risk factor for MS later in life. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels in early pregnancy are associated with risk of MS in offspring. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective, nested case-control study in the Finnish Maternity Cohort conducted in May 2011. We identified 193 individuals with a diagnosis of MS before December 31, 2009, whose mothers are in the Finnish Maternity Cohort and had an available serum sample from the pregnancy with the affected child. We matched 176 cases with 326 controls on region of birth in Finland, date of maternal serum sample collection, date of mother's birth, and date of child's birth. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Maternal serum 25(OH)D levels were measured using a chemiluminescence assay. The risk of MS among offspring and association with maternal 25(OH)D levels were the main outcomes. Conditional logistic regression was used and further adjusted for sex of the child, gestational age at the time of sample collection, and season of sample collection to estimate the relative risks and 95\% CIs. RESULTS: Of the 193 cases in the study, 163 were female. Of the 331 controls in the study, 218 were female. Seventy percent of serum samples were collected during the first trimester of pregnancy. The mean (SD) maternal vitamin D levels were in the insufficient vitamin D range, but higher in maternal control than case samples (15.02 [6.41] ng/mL vs 13.86 [5.49] ng/mL [to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 2.496]). Maternal vitamin D deficiency (25[OH]D levels {\textless}12.02 ng/mL) during early pregnancy was associated with a nearly 2-fold increased risk of MS in the offspring (relative risk, 1.90; 95\% CI, 1.20-3.01; P = .006) compared with women who did not have deficient 25(OH)D levels. There was no statistically significant association between the risk of MS and increasing serum 25(OH)D levels (P = .12). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Insufficient maternal 25(OH)D during pregnancy may increase the risk of MS in offspring.},

The association between childhood SES and MS was evaluated using MS incidence rate ratios with 95\% confidence intervals obtained in log-linear Poisson regression analyses. We found no strong association between childhood SES and MS but did observe a tendency toward a reduced risk of MS among children from households with more highly educated parents, particularly mothers. Children whose mothers had a secondary (rate ratio = 0.95, 95\% confidence interval: 0.86, 1.04) or higher (rate ratio = 0.86, 95\% confidence interval: 0.76, 0.97) education had reduced risks of MS (5\% and 14\%, respectively) compared with children of mothers with a basic education (P for trend = 0.02). Results were practically unchanged in an analysis restricted to persons aged 15-29 years, among whom the possible effect of own SES on MS risk is considered limited. Overall, SES in childhood seems of no major importance for the subsequent risk of MS; however, offspring of well-educated mothers may be at a slightly reduced risk of MS.},

We use causal diagrams to display the sources of the problems. Presentation of exposure and confounder effect estimates from a single model may lead to several interpretative difficulties, inviting confusion of direct-effect estimates with total-effect estimates for covariates in the model. These effect estimates may also be confounded even though the effect estimate for the main exposure is not confounded. Interpretation of these effect estimates is further complicated by heterogeneity (variation, modification) of the exposure effect measure across covariate levels. We offer suggestions to limit potential misunderstandings when multiple effect estimates are presented, including precise distinction between total and direct effect measures from a single model, and use of multiple models tailored to yield total-effect estimates for covariates.},

	abstract = {Low birth weight (LBW) infants have lower infant mortality in groups in which LBW is most frequent. For example, in 1991, US infants born to smokers had higher risks of both LBW and infant mortality than infants born to nonsmokers. However, among LBW infants, infant mortality was lower for infants born to smokers (relative rate = 0.79). There are competing theories regarding this so-called "paradox." One is that maternal smoking is beneficial for LBW infants. The authors use causal diagrams to show that, even in the absence of any beneficial effect of smoking, an inverse association due to stratification on birth weight can be found. This variable is affected by the exposure of interest and shares common causes with the outcome. That is, LBW infants born to smokers may have a lower risk of mortality than other LBW infants whose LBW is due to causes associated with high mortality (e.g., birth defects). Under realistic causal diagrams, adjustment for birth weight is unwarranted when the analytical goal is to estimate overall effects of prenatal variables on infant mortality. Even for estimating direct effects of prenatal variables, adjustment for birth weight may be invalid when there is an unmeasured common cause of LBW and mortality. An appropriate justification for conditioning on birth weight requires specifying 1) the causal question motivating this analytical approach and 2) the assumptions regarding the proposed underlying biologic mechanisms.},

The proposed concepts and methods are useful for particular problems, but it would be of concern if the theory and practice of the complete field of epidemiology were to become restricted to this single approach to causal inference. Our concerns are that this theory restricts the questions that epidemiologists may ask and the study designs that they may consider. It also restricts the evidence that may be considered acceptable to assess causality, and thereby the evidence that may be considered acceptable for scientific and public health decision making. These restrictions are based on a particular conceptual framework for thinking about causality. In Section 1, we describe the characteristics of the restricted potential outcomes approach (RPOA) and show that there is a methodological movement which advocates these principles, not just for solving particular problems, but as ideals for which epidemiology as a whole should strive. In Section 2, we seek to show that the limitation of epidemiology to one particular view of the nature of causality is problematic. In Section 3, we argue that the RPOA is also problematic with regard to the assessment of causality. We argue that it threatens to restrict study design choice, to wrongly discredit the results of types of observational studies that have been very useful in the past and to damage the teaching of epidemiological reasoning. Finally, in Section 4 we set out what we regard as a more reasonable 'working hypothesis' as to the nature of causality and its assessment: pragmatic pluralism.},

Big data in the context of epidemiologic research means large interlinkable data sets within a single country or networks of multinational databases. Several Nordic, European, and other multinational collaborations are now well established. Advantages of big data for clinical epidemiology include improved precision of estimates, which is especially important for reassuring ("null") findings; ability to conduct meaningful analyses in subgroup of patients; and rapid detection of safety signals. Big data will also provide new possibilities for research by enabling access to linked information from biobanks, electronic medical records, patient-reported outcome measures, automatic and semiautomatic electronic monitoring devices, and social media. The sheer amount of data, however, does not eliminate and may even amplify systematic error. Therefore, methodologies addressing systematic error, clinical knowledge, and underlying hypotheses are more important than ever to ensure that the signal is discernable behind the noise.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pmed.0040352},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In conventional epidemiology confounding of the exposure of interest with lifestyle or socioeconomic factors, and reverse causation whereby disease status influences exposure rather than vice versa, may invalidate causal interpretations of observed associations. Conversely, genetic variants should not be related to the confounding factors that distort associations in conventional observational epidemiological studies. Furthermore, disease onset will not influence genotype. Therefore, it has been suggested that genetic variants that are known to be associated with a modifiable (nongenetic) risk factor can be used to help determine the causal effect of this modifiable risk factor on disease outcomes. This approach, mendelian randomization, is increasingly being applied within epidemiological studies. However, there is debate about the underlying premise that associations between genotypes and disease outcomes are not confounded by other risk factors. We examined the extent to which genetic variants, on the one hand, and nongenetic environmental exposures or phenotypic characteristics on the other, tend to be associated with each other, to assess the degree of confounding that would exist in conventional epidemiological studies compared with mendelian randomization studies. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We estimated pairwise correlations between nongenetic baseline variables and genetic variables in a cross-sectional study comparing the number of correlations that were statistically significant at the 5\%, 1\%, and 0.01\% level (alpha = 0.05, 0.01, and 0.0001, respectively) with the number expected by chance if all variables were in fact uncorrelated, using a two-sided binomial exact test. We demonstrate that behavioural, socioeconomic, and physiological factors are strongly interrelated, with 45\% of all possible pairwise associations between 96 nongenetic characteristics (n = 4,560 correlations) being significant at the p {\textless} 0.01 level (the ratio of observed to expected significant associations was 45; p-value for difference between observed and expected {\textless} 0.000001). Similar findings were observed for other levels of significance. In contrast, genetic variants showed no greater association with each other, or with the 96 behavioural, socioeconomic, and physiological factors, than would be expected by chance. CONCLUSIONS: These data illustrate why observational studies have produced misleading claims regarding potentially causal factors for disease. The findings demonstrate the potential power of a methodology that utilizes genetic variants as indicators of exposure level when studying environmentally modifiable risk factors.},

	abstract = {The propensity score is defined as a subject's probability of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates. Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects. However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment. We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups. We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample. The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher-order moments, and interactions. The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample. Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study. We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute towards an evolving concept of 'best practice' when using IPTW to estimate causal treatment effects using observational data.},

The absence of associations of genetic variants (e.g. rs671 in ALDH2) with such risk factors in women - who drank little in these populations - provides evidence that the observations are not due to genetic pleiotropy. Here, we present a Mendelian randomisation study in a South Korean population (3,365 men and 3,787 women) that 1) provides robust evidence that alcohol consumption adversely affects several cardiovascular disease risk factors, including blood pressure, waist to hip ratio, fasting blood glucose and triglyceride levels. Alcohol also increases HDL cholesterol and lowers LDL cholesterol. Our study also 2) replicates sex differences in associations which suggests pleiotropy does not underlie the associations, 3) provides further evidence that association is not due to pleiotropy by showing null effects in male non-drinkers, and 4) illustrates a way to measure population-level association where alcohol intake is stratified by sex. In conclusion, population-level instrumental variable estimation (utilizing interaction of rs671 in ALDH2 and sex as an instrument) strengthens causal inference regarding the largely adverse influence of alcohol intake on cardiovascular health in an Asian population.},

This review focuses on 3 key areas to critically assess the association of sPTD and future maternal CVD risk: (1) CVD risk factors, (2) inflammatory biomarkers of interest, and (3) specific forms of vascular dysfunction, such as endothelial function and arterial stiffness, and mechanisms by which each may be linked to sPTD. The association of sPTD with subsequent future maternal CVD risk suggests that a woman's abnormal response to pregnancy may serve as her first physiological stress test.

METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, 360 pregnant women presenting with threatened miscarriage between gestation weeks 6-10 at a tertiary hospital emergency unit for women in Singapore were recruited for this study. The main outcome measure measured is spontaneous miscarriage prior to week 16 of gestation. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) and test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value) at a serum progesterone cutpoint of {\textless}35 nmol/L for predicting high and low risk of spontaneous miscarriage by 16 weeks were compared between the Pilot and Validation cohorts. RESULTS: Test characteristics and AUC values using serum progesterone {\textless}35 nmol/L in the validation cohort were not significantly different from those in the Pilot cohort, demonstrating excellent accuracy and reproducibility of the proposed serum progesterone cut-off level.

Approximately one in four of these patients go on to have spontaneous miscarriage and the etiology of miscarriage still remains elusive. In a bid to identify possible biomarkers and novel treatment targets, many studies have been undertaken to elucidate the pathways that lead to a miscarriage. Luteal phase deficiency has been shown to contribute to miscarriages, and the measurement of serum progesterone as a prognostic marker and the prescription of progesterone supplementation has been proposed as possible diagnostic and treatment methods. However, luteal phase deficiency only accounts for 35\% of miscarriages. In order to understand the other causes of spontaneous miscarriage and possible novel urine biomarkers for miscarriage, we looked at the changes in urinary metabolites in women with threatened miscarriage. To this end, we performed a case-control study of eighty patients who presented with threatened miscarriage between 6 and 10 weeks gestation. Urine metabolomics analyses of forty patients with spontaneous miscarriages and forty patients with ongoing pregnancies at 16 weeks gestation point to an impaired placental mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids as the possible cause of spontaneous miscarriage. This study also highlighted the potential of urine metabolites as a non-invasive screening tool for the risk stratification of women presenting with threatened miscarriage.},

Periostin (PER), whose levels rise particularly during injury or inflammation, has been shown to play an important local role in implantation and early embryonic development. As PER has been described as a biomarker in various medical conditions we intended to evaluate if changes in PER serum levels may help to identify women at risk for spontaneous abortion in the first trimester. METHODS: Women between 18 and 42 years without confounding comorbidities who conceived by IVF/ICSI and ovarian hyperstimulation were analysed in the study after informed consent. Maternal serum samples from 41 patients were assessed at the time of pregnancy testing (PT) and the following first ultrasound checkup (US). Patients were subsequently divided in two groups: (1) patients with subsequent miscarriage in the first trimester (n = 18) and (2) patients with ongoing pregnancy (n = 23), allowing for statistical analysis and investigating the change of PER levels per individual. PER levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Statistical analysis was performed using the Fisher exact and Student's t test. p {\textless}/= 0.05 was considered to be significant. RESULTS: There was no significant difference concerning possible confounders between the two groups. We did not find any significant difference in PER levels at the time point of PT or US. By investigating the interindividual changes of PER between the two time points however, we observed that patients with a following miscarriage showed increasing levels of PER at the time point of PT compared to US in contrast to patients with an ongoing pregnancy who demonstrated a decrease in PER levels. These alterations were significant in the absolute as well as in the relative comparison. CONCLUSION: The relative expression of PER between PT and US is significantly altered in asymptomatic women with subsequent miscarriage compared to women with ongoing pregnancy. Therefore systemic PER levels might represent a potential promising biomarker for the assessment of pregnancy outcome. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable.},

In contrast, structural models provide consistent estimates of causal effects when unmeasured confounding and model misspecification are absent. The parameters of nested structural models are estimated by g-estimation and those of marginal structural models by inverse probability weighting. METHODS: We describe a nested structural accelerated failure time model and use it to estimate the total causal effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the time to AIDS or death among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort and Women's Interagency HIV Studies. The Appendix describes g-estimation and methods to deal with censoring. RESULTS: Comparing the regime 'always treated' to 'never treated,' the AIDS-free survival time ratio was 2.5 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7, 3.3). CONCLUSIONS: Our finding of a strongly beneficial effect is consistent with results from randomized trials and from a previous analysis of the same data using a marginal structural Cox model. In contrast, a previous analysis using a standard (non-structural) model did not find an effect of treatment on survival.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using data from The Health Improvement Network, we identified women who have given live birth and their offspring. Four subgroups were selected based on the AED treatment in early pregnancy, valproate, carbamazepine, lamotrigine and women not receiving AED treatment. We compared the prevalence of major congenital malformations within children of these four groups and estimated prevalence ratios (PRs) using Poisson regression adjusted for maternal age, sex of child, quintiles of Townsend deprivation score and indication for treatment. RESULTS: In total, 240,071 women were included in the study. A total of 229 women were prescribed valproate in pregnancy, 357 were prescribed lamotrigine and 334 were prescribed carbamazepine and 239,151 women were not prescribed AEDs. Fifteen out of 229 (6.6\%) women prescribed valproate gave birth to a child with a major congenital malformation. The figures for lamotrigine, carbamazepine and women not prescribed AEDs were 2.7\%, 3.3\% and 2.2\%, respectively. The prevalence of major congenital malformation was similar for women prescribed lamotrigine or carbamazepine compared to women with no AED treatment in pregnancy. For women prescribed valproate in polytherapy, the prevalence was fourfold higher. After adjustments, the effect of estimates attenuated, but the prevalence remained two- to threefold higher in women prescribed valproate. CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that lamotrigine and carbamazepine are safer treatment options than valproate in pregnancy and should be considered as alternative treatment options for women of childbearing potential and in pregnancy.},

This paper describes a simple method to compare dynamic treatment regimes by artificially censoring subjects and then using inverse probability weighting (IPW) to adjust for any selection bias introduced by the artificial censoring. The basic strategy can be summarized in four steps: 1) define two regimes of interest, 2) artificially censor individuals when they stop following one of the regimes of interest, 3) estimate inverse probability weights to adjust for the potential selection bias introduced by censoring in the previous step, 4) compare the survival of the uncensored individuals under each regime of interest by fitting an inverse probability weighted Cox proportional hazards model with the dichotomous regime indicator and the baseline confounders as covariates. In the absence of model misspecification, the method is valid provided data are available on all time-varying and baseline joint predictors of survival and regime discontinuation. We present an application of the method to compare the AIDS-free survival under two dynamic treatment regimes in a large prospective study of HIV-infected patients. The paper concludes by discussing the relative advantages and disadvantages of censoring/IPW versus g-estimation of nested structural models to compare dynamic regimes.},

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective observational study using electronic medical records of individuals aged 55-84 with coronary heart disease from {\textgreater}500 practices in the United Kingdom between 2000-2010. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat mortality hazard ratio (95\% confidence interval) was 0.90 (0.84, 0.97) for statins versus no treatment, 0.88 (0.73, 1.06) for statins plus antihypertensives versus no treatment, and 0.91 (0.77, 1.06) for atorvastatin versus simvastatin. When censoring non-adherent person-times, the per-protocol mortality hazard ratio was 0.74 (0.64, 0.85) for statins versus no treatment, 0.55 (0.35, 0.87) for statins plus antihypertensives versus no treatment, and 1.13 (0.88, 1.45) for atorvastatin versus simvastatin. We estimated per-protocol hazard ratios for a 5-year treatment using different dose-response marginal structural models, and standardized survival curves for each target trial using intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: At least 40\% of patients with cirrhosis have comorbidities that increase mortality. We developed a cirrhosis-specific comorbidity scoring system (CirCom) to help determine how these comorbidities affect mortality and compared it with the generic Charlson Comorbidity Index. METHODS: We used data from nationwide health care registries to identify Danish citizens diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1999-2008 (n = 12,976). They were followed through 2010 and characterized by 34 comorbidities. We used Cox regression to assign severity weights to comorbidities with an adjusted mortality hazard ratio (HR) {\textgreater}/= 1.20. Each patient's CirCom score was based on, at most, 2 of these comorbidities. Performance was measured with Harrell's C statistic and the Net Reclassification Index (NRI) and results were compared with those obtained using the Charlson Index (based on 17 comorbidities). Findings were validated in 2 separate cohorts of patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis C. RESULTS: The CirCom score included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease, epilepsy, substance abuse, heart failure, nonmetastatic cancer, metastatic cancer, and chronic kidney disease; 24.2\% of patients had 1 or more of these, and mortality correlated with the CirCom score. Patients' CirCom score correlated with their Charlson Comorbidity Index (Kendall's tau = 0.57; P {\textless} .0001). Compared with the Charlson Index, the CirCom score increased Harrell's C statistic by 0.6\% (95\% confidence interval: 0.3\%-0.8\%). The NRI for the CirCom score was 5.2\% (95\% confidence interval: 3.7\%-6.9\%), and the NRI for the Charlson Index was 3.6\% (95\% confidence interval: 2.3\%-5.0\%). Similar results were obtained from the validation cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a scoring system to predict mortality among patients with cirrhosis based on 9 comorbidities. This system had higher C statistic and NRI values than the Charlson Comorbidity Index, and is easier to use. It could therefore be a preferred method to predict death or survival of patients and for use in epidemiologic studies.},

	abstract = {Propensity score methods are used to reduce the effects of observed confounding when using observational data to estimate the effects of treatments or exposures. A popular method of using the propensity score is inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). When using this method, a weight is calculated for each subject that is equal to the inverse of the probability of receiving the treatment that was actually received. These weights are then incorporated into the analyses to minimize the effects of observed confounding. Previous research has found that these methods result in unbiased estimation when estimating the effect of treatment on survival outcomes. However, conventional methods of variance estimation were shown to result in biased estimates of standard error. In this study, we conducted an extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations to examine different methods of variance estimation when using a weighted Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the effect of treatment. We considered three variance estimation methods: (i) a naive model-based variance estimator; (ii) a robust sandwich-type variance estimator; and (iii) a bootstrap variance estimator. We considered estimation of both the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect in the treated. We found that the use of a bootstrap estimator resulted in approximately correct estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with the correct coverage rates. The other estimators resulted in biased estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals with incorrect coverage rates. Our simulations were informed by a case study examining the effect of statin prescribing on mortality. (c) 2016 The Authors. Statistics in Medicine published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

In this paper, we study the proportional hazards regression model for the subdistribution of a competing risk with proper adjustments for covariate-dependent censoring. We consider a covariate-adjusted weight function by fitting the Cox model for the censoring distribution and using the predictive probability for each individual. Our simulation study shows that the covariate-adjusted weight estimator is basically unbiased when the censoring time depends on the covariates, and the covariate-adjusted weight approach works well for the variance estimator as well.

	abstract = {For a given regression problem it is possible to identify a suitably defined equivalent two-sample problem such that the power or sample size obtained for the two-sample problem also applies to the regression problem. For a standard linear regression model the equivalent two-sample problem is easily identified, but for generalized linear models and for Cox regression models the situation is more complicated. An approximately equivalent two-sample problem may, however, also be identified here. In particular, we show that for logistic regression and Cox regression models the equivalent two-sample problem is obtained by selecting two equally sized samples for which the parameters differ by a value equal to the slope times twice the standard deviation of the independent variable and further requiring that the overall expected number of events is unchanged. In a simulation study we examine the validity of this approach to power calculations in logistic regression and Cox regression models. Several different covariate distributions are considered for selected values of the overall response probability and a range of alternatives. For the Cox regression model we consider both constant and non-constant hazard rates. The results show that in general the approach is remarkably accurate even in relatively small samples. Some discrepancies are, however, found in small samples with few events and a highly skewed covariate distribution. Comparison with results based on alternative methods for logistic regression models with a single continuous covariate indicates that the proposed method is at least as good as its competitors. The method is easy to implement and therefore provides a simple way to extend the range of problems that can be covered by the usual formulas for power and sample size determination.},

One of the strengths of HARE is that its model fitting procedure has an implicit check for proportionality of the underlying hazards model. It also provides an explicit model for the conditional hazards function, which makes it very convenient to obtain graphical summaries. On the other hand, the tree-based methods automatically partition a dataset into groups of cases that are similar in survival history.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Determination of C-reactive protein (CRP) level has been suggested to improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment. This study examines the utility of CRP levels to assess CVD risk in a community setting. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational cohort study on a community population sample. A total of 1949 men and 2497 women without CVD from the Framingham Heart Study underwent CVD risk factor assessment. Initial CVD events during 8 years of follow-up were recorded. RESULTS: There were 283 major CVD and 160 major coronary heart disease incident events. Age-, sex-, and multivariable-adjusted analyses generally used CRP level categories of less than 1, 1 to 3, and greater than 3 mg/L. In age- and sex-adjusted models, the traditional risk factors and elevated CRP levels indicated increased risk. The age- and sex-adjusted relative risk (RR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) of CRP level greater than 3 mg/L for major CVD was elevated (RR, 1.60; 95\% CI, 1.19-2.14), with evidence of attenuation (RR, 1.22; 95\% CI, 0.90-1.66) in multivariable models. The C statistic, a measure of the discriminatory capability of the prediction models, was 0.74 for prediction of major CVD with age and CRP level. In multivariable models that included traditional risk factors, the C statistic was 0.78, a value that was unchanged with the addition of CRP to the multivariable model. Similar relations were noted for major coronary heart disease events. CONCLUSION: Elevated CRP level provided no further prognostic information beyond traditional office risk factor assessment to predict future major CVD and major coronary heart disease in this population sample.},

In contrast, the recently developed marginal structural models (MSMs) can provide consistent estimates of causal effects when unmeasured confounding and model misspecification are absent. We describe an MSM for repeated measures that parameterizes the marginal means of counterfactual outcomes corresponding to prespecified treatment regimes. The parameters of MSMs are estimated using a new class of estimators - inverse-probability of treatment weighted estimators. We used an MSM to estimate the effect of zidovudine therapy on mean CD4 count among HIV-infected men in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. We estimated a potential expected increase of 5.4 (95 per cent confidence interval -1.8,12.7) CD4 lymphocytes/l per additional study visit while on zidovudine therapy.

Like g-estimation of structural nested models and inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models, the parametric g-formula can appropriately adjust for measured time-varying confounders that are affected by prior treatment. However, there have been few implementations of the parametric g-formula to date. Here, we apply the parametric g-formula to assess the impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy on time to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or death in two US-based human immunodeficiency virus cohorts including 1498 participants. These participants contributed approximately 7300 person-years of follow-up (49\% exposed to highly active antiretroviral therapy) during which 382 events occurred and 259 participants were censored because of dropout. Using the parametric g-formula, we estimated that antiretroviral therapy substantially reduces the hazard of AIDS or death (hazard ratio = 0.55; 95\% confidence limits [CL]: 0.42, 0.71). This estimate was similar to one previously reported using a marginal structural model, 0.54 (95\% CL: 0.38, 0.78). The 6.5-year difference in risk of AIDS or death was 13\% (95\% CL: 8\%, 18\%). Results were robust to assumptions about temporal ordering, and extent of history modeled, for time-varying covariates. The parametric g-formula is a viable alternative to inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models and g-estimation of structural nested models for the analysis of complex longitudinal data.},

	abstract = {When estimating the effect of treatment on HIV using data from observational studies, standard methods may produce biased estimates due to the presence of time-dependent confounders. Such confounding can be present when a covariate, affected by past exposure, is both a predictor of the future exposure and the outcome. One example is the CD4 cell count, being a marker for disease progression for HIV patients, but also a marker for treatment initiation and influenced by treatment. Fitting a marginal structural model (MSM) using inverse probability weights is one way to give appropriate adjustment for this type of confounding. In this paper we study a simple and intuitive approach to estimate similar treatment effects, using observational data to mimic several randomized controlled trials. Each 'trial' is constructed based on individuals starting treatment in a certain time interval. An overall effect estimate for all such trials is found using composite likelihood inference. The method offers an alternative to the use of inverse probability of treatment weights, which is unstable in certain situations. The estimated parameter is not identical to the one of an MSM, it is conditioned on covariate values at the start of each mimicked trial. This allows the study of questions that are not that easily addressed fitting an MSM. The analysis can be performed as a stratified weighted Cox analysis on the joint data set of all the constructed trials, where each trial is one stratum. The model is applied to data from the Swiss HIV cohort study.},

	abstract = {A hypercoagulable or prothrombotic state of malignancy occurs due to the ability of tumor cells to activate the coagulation system. It has been estimated that hypercoagulation accounts for a significant percentage of mortality and morbidity in cancer patients. Prothrombotic factors in cancer include the ability of tumor cells to produce and secrete procoagulant/fibrinolytic substances and inflammatory cytokines, and the physical interaction between tumor cell and blood (monocytes, platelets, neutrophils) or vascular cells. Other mechanisms of thrombus promotion in malignancy include nonspecific factors such as the generation of acute phase reactants and necrosis (i.e., inflammation), abnormal protein metabolism (i.e., paraproteinemia), and hemodynamic compromise (i.e., stasis). In addition, anticancer therapy (i.e., surgery/chemotherapy/hormone therapy) may significantly increase the risk of thromboembolic events by similar mechanisms, e.g., procoagulant release, endothelial damage, or stimulation of tissue factor production by host cells. However, not all of the mechanisms for the production of a hypercoagulable state of cancer are entirely understood. In this review, we attempt to describe what is currently accepted about the pathophysiology of the hypercoagulable state of cancer. We also discuss whether or not to screen patients with idiopathic deep venous thrombosis for an underlying malignancy, and whether this would be beneficial to patients. It is hoped that a better understanding of these mechanisms will ultimately lead to the development of more targeted treatment to prevent thromboembolic complications in cancer patients. It is also hoped that antithrombotic strategies may also have a positive effect on the process of tumor growth and dissemination.},

We used multivariate logistic regression to evaluate factors in relation to risk of ovarian cancer and the major tumour histologic subtypes. Ovarian cancer risk was reduced among parous women, relative to nulliparous women (OR = 0.4; 95\% CI = 0.3-0.6). Among parous women, higher parity (P = 0.0006), increased age at first (P = 0.03) or last (P = 0.05) birth, and time since last birth (P = 0.04) were associated with reduced risk. Early pregnancy losses, abortions, and stillbirths were unrelated to risk, but preterm, term, and twin births were protective. Risk was lower among women who had breast-fed, relative to those who had not (OR = 0.7; 95\% CI = 0.5-1.0), but the average duration of breast-feeding per child was unrelated to risk (P for trend = 0.21). Age at menarche and age at menopause were unrelated to risk overall, although increasing menarcheal age was protective among premenopausal women (P = 0.02). Menstrual cycle characteristics and symptoms were generally unrelated to risk, although cycle-related insomnia was associated with decreased risk (OR = 0.5; 95\% CI = 0.3-0.8). We found no association between the type of sanitary product used during menstruation and ovarian cancer risk. In analyses by histologic subtype, reproductive and menstrual factors had most effect on risk of endometrioid/clear cell tumours, and least influential with regard to risk of mucinous tumours.

	abstract = {Ovarian and other hormones are major determinants of breast cancer risk. Particularly important is the accumulative exposure of the breast to circulating levels of the ovarian hormones estradiol and progesterone. A number of breast cancer risk factors can be understood in light of how they affect women's hormone profiles. Age is a marker for the onset and cessation of ovarian activity. Racial differences in hormone profiles correlate with breast cancer incidence patterns. Age at menarche not only serves as the chronological indicator of the onset of ovarian activity, but as a predictor of ovulatory frequency during adolescence and hormone levels in young adults, and has a long-lasting influence on risk. Age at menopause, another established breast cancer risk factor, marks the cessation of ovarian activity. Pregnancy history and lactation experience also are hormonal markers of breast cancer risk. Postmenopausal obesity, which is associated with higher levels of estrogen following cessation of ovarian activity, increases breast cancer risk, whereas physical activity, which can limit menstrual function, reduces risk. A relatively recent area of investigation is prenatal exposures like preeclampsia and low birth weight; both may be associated with lower in utero exposure to estrogen and also may predict lower breast cancer risk as an adult. Improved understanding of these exposures and their potential interactions with breast cancer susceptibility genes may, in the future, improve our prospects for breast cancer prevention.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological, clinical, and experimental data indicate that the risk of developing breast cancer is strongly dependent on the ovary and on endocrine conditions modulated by ovarian function, such as early menarche, late menopause, and parity. Women who gave birth to a child when they were younger than 24 years of age exhibit a decrease in their lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, and additional pregnancies increase the protection. The breast tissue of normally cycling women contains three identifiable types of lobules, the undifferentiated Lobules type 1 (Lob 1) and the more developed Lobules type 2 and Lobules type 3. The breast attains its maximum development during pregnancy and lactation (Lobules type 4). After menopause the breast regresses in both nulliparous and parous women containing only Lob 1. Despite the similarity in the lobular composition of the breast at menopause, the fact that nulliparous women are at higher risk of developing breast cancer than parous women indicates that Lob 1 in these two groups of women might be biologically different, or might exhibit different susceptibility to carcinogenesis. Based on these observations it was postulated that Lob 1 found in the breast of nulliparous women and of parous women with breast cancer never went through the process of differentiation, retaining a high concentration of epithelial cells that are targets for carcinogens and are therefore susceptible to undergo neoplastic transformation. These epithelial cells are called Stem cells 1, whereas Lob 1 structures found in the breast of early parous postmenopausal women free of mammary pathology, on the contrary, are composed of an epithelial cell population that is refractory to transformation, called Stem cells 2. It was further postulated that the degree of differentiation acquired through early pregnancy has changed the 'genomic signature' that differentiates Lob 1 of the early parous women from that of the nulliparous women by shifting the Stem cells 1 to Stem cells 2 that are refractory to carcinogenesis, making this the postulated mechanism of protection conferred by early full-term pregnancy. The identification of a putative breast stem cell (Stem cells 1) has, in the past decade, reached a significant impulse, and several markers also reported for other tissues have been found in the mammary epithelial cells of both rodents and humans. Although further work needs to be carried out in order to better understand the role of the Stem cells 2 and their interaction with the genes that confer them a specific signature, collectively the data presently available provide evidence that pregnancy, through the process of cell differentiation, shifts Stem cells 1 to Stem cells 2 - cells that exhibit a specific genomic signature that could be responsible for the refractoriness of the mammary gland to carcinogenesis.},

This report presents the first meta-analysis of results from epidemiological studies that have investigated parity, age at first birth, breastfeeding, and age at menarche in relation to ER+PR+ and ER-PR- cancer risk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We calculated summary relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) using a fixed effects model. RESULTS: Each birth reduced the risk of ER+PR+ cancer by 11\% (RR per birth = 0.89, 95\% CI = 0.84-0.94), and women who were in the highest age at first birth category had, on average, 27\% higher risk of ER+PR+ cancer compared with women who were in the youngest age at first birth category (RR = 1.27, 95\% CI = 1.07-1.50). Neither parity nor age at first birth was associated with the risk of ER-PR- cancer (RR per birth = 0.99, 95\% CI = 0.94-1.05; RR of oldest versus youngest age at first birth category = 1.01, 95\% CI = 0.85-1.20). Breastfeeding and late age at menarche decreased the risk of both receptor subtypes of breast cancer. The protective effect of late age at menarche was statistically significantly greater for ER+PR+ than ER-PR- cancer (RR = 0.72 for ER+PR+ cancer; RR = 0.84 for ER-PR- cancer, p for homogeneity = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that breastfeeding (and age at menarche) may act through different hormonal mechanisms than do parity and age at first birth.},

The overall data-set included women below age 75 with histologically confirmed cancers of the following sites: oesophagus, 58; stomach, 280; colon, 405; rectum, 210; liver, 82; gall-bladder, 29; pancreas, 129; breast, 3,415; cervix, 742; endometrium, 725; ovary, 953; bladder, 68; kidney, 56; thyroid, 180; lymphomas, 80; myelomas, 57; and a total of 5,619 controls admitted to hospital for acute non-neoplastic, non-gynaecological, non-hormone-related conditions. Multivariate odds ratios, as estimators of relative risks (RR), were obtained after allowance for age, education, use of oral contraceptives and oestrogen replacement treatments, plus various reproductive factors. Direct significant trends with parity were observed for cancer of the liver (RR for women with {\textgreater} or = 4 births vs. nulliparae = 3.3) and cervix uteri (RR = 4.1). The risk of gall-bladder cancer was also elevated for multiparae (RR = 1.9). No significant inverse trend in risk emerged. However, the RRs in multiparae were significantly below unity for breast (RR = 0.8), endometrium (RR = 0.7), and ovary (RR = 0.8). With reference to age at first birth, a significant trend in risk was observed for breast cancer (RR = 1.4 for 25 to 29 and 1.5 for {\textgreater} or = 30 vs. {\textless} 25 years). In contrast, the risk of cervical cancer was inversely related to age at first birth. For spontaneous abortions, the only significant inverse trend was for ovarian cancer (RR = 0.7 for {\textgreater} or = 2 vs. 0 abortions), but also the point estimate for endometrial cancer in women with {\textgreater} or = 2 abortions was below unity. For induced abortions, there was a strong inverse trend in risk for endometrial cancer (RR = 0.5), and the RRs were below unity also for colon and breast cancer. In contrast, cervical cancer was directly associated with the number of spontaneous abortions. Although the underlying aetiological interpretations are different for various cancer sites, this study provides, in a large and uniform data-set, quantitative information on the long-term impact of reproductive factors on cancer risk.
Between 1983 and 1992 in greater Milan, Italy, staff at the Italian National Cancer Institute, several university hospitals, and the Ospedale Maggiore collected data on women under 75 years old with various forms of cancer. Researchers aggregated the cancer data as well as data on women with no cancer from various medical facilities to examine the effect of reproductive factors on the risks of various cancers. They controlled for age, education, use of oral contraceptives and estrogen replacement treatments, and some various reproductive factors. Parity increased the relative risk (RR) of developing liver cancer (RR for women with =or 4 births vs. nulliparae = 3.3; p .05) and of developing cervical cancer (RR = 4.1 p .01). Multiparity appeared to exert a protective effect against breast cancer (RR = .8), endometrial cancer (RR = .7), and ovarian cancer (RR = .8) (p .05 for all 3 cancers). The older the women were at 1st birth, the greater the RR of developing breast cancer (RR - 1.4 for age 25-29 and 1.5 for =or age 30 vs. 25 years; p .01). On the other hand, the RR of developing cervical cancer decreased with increasing age at 1st birth (RR = 0.7 for age 25-29 and 0.6 for =or age 30; p .05). Miscarriages exerted a significant trend only on ovarian cancer (RR = 0.7 for =or 2; p .05 for the trend), but at least 2 miscarriages also appeared to protect against endometrial cancer (RR = 0.6; p .05). Induced abortions exerted a strong protective effect against endometrial cancer (RR = .05 for at least 1 abortion; p .01 for the trend [X = 17.49]). They also had a protective effect against colon cancer (RR = 0.4 for at least 2 abortions; p .05) and breast cancer (RR = 0.8; p .05). On the other hand, induced abortions increased the RR of developing cervical cancer (RR = 1.5 for at least 1 abortion; p .01 for the trend [X = 13.61]). These findings provide a quantitative data set on the positive or negative longterm effect of reproductive factors on cancer risk.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that pregnant and recently pregnant women enjoy a "healthy pregnant women effect," we compared the all natural cause mortality rates for women who were pregnant or within 1 year of pregnancy termination with all other women of reproductive age. STUDY DESIGN: This is a population-based, retrospective cohort study from Finland for a 14-year period, 1987 to 2000. Information on all deaths of women aged 15 to 49 years in Finland (n=15,823) was received from the Cause-of-Death Register and linked to the Medical Birth Register (n=865,988 live births and stillbirths), the Register on Induced Abortions (n=156,789 induced abortions), and the Hospital Discharge Register (n=118,490 spontaneous abortions) to identify pregnancy-associated deaths (n=419). RESULTS: The age-adjusted mortality rate for women during pregnancy and within 1 year of pregnancy termination was 36.7 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies, which was significantly lower than the mortality rate among nonpregnant women, 57.0 per 100,000 person-years (relative risk [RR] 0.64, 95\% CI 0.58-0.71). The mortality was lower after a birth (28.2/100,000) than after a spontaneous (51.9/100,000) or induced abortion (83.1/100,000). We observed a significant increase in the risk of death from cerebrovascular diseases after delivery among women aged 15 to 24 years (RR 4.08, 95\% CI 1.58-10.55). CONCLUSION: Our study supports the healthy pregnant woman effect for all pregnancies, including those not ending in births.},

	abstract = {Inflammation and cancer stem cells (CSCs) are becoming increasingly recognized as components of tumorigenesis in breast cancer. In the present study, the association between inflammation and BCSC phenotype was evaluated in human breast cancer tissue. Immunohistochemical staining for cluster of differentiation (CD)24, 44, 4, 8 and 68 was performed using tissue microarray blocks containing 47 consecutive cases of invasive breast carcinoma and 10 normal breast tissue samples. The levels of inflammatory modulators and cytokines, and intratumoral or peritumoral lymphocyte infiltration, were assessed. BCSCs were defined as CD44(+)/CD24(-) tumor cells. In total, 21.3\% of samples exhibited the CD44(+)/CD24(-) phenotype. This phenotype was identified to be significantly inversely associated with lymph node metastasis. In addition, the CD44(+)/CD24(-) phenotype was significantly associated with the molecular subtype of breast cancer, and was particularly increased in the basal-like subtype. Furthermore, the CD44(+)/CD24(-) phenotype was significantly associated with intratumoral inflammation and tumor-infiltrating CD4(+) T cell counts. Notably, tumor-infiltrating CD4(+) T cells were significantly increased in patients with the basal-like molecular subtype of breast cancer. In conclusion, the present study identified a significant association between inflammation and the CD44(+)/CD24(-) phenotype in breast cancer. These results suggest that the interaction between inflammation and CSCs may affect the tumorigenesis and progression of breast cancer. Further studies are required to clarify the role of inflammation and CSCs in breast cancer.},

Moreover, obesity increases the level of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6) and has a significant impact on selected adipokines.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antidepressant exposure during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in several observational studies. We performed a systematic review of these studies to highlight the effect that important methodological limitations have on such analyses and to consider approaches to the conduct, reporting and interpretation of future studies. METHODS: A review of MEDLINE and EMBASE identified case-control, cohort and sibling studies assessing the risk of ASD and ADHD with antidepressant use during pregnancy. Approaches to confounding adjustment were described. Crude and adjusted effect estimates for comparisons between antidepressant exposure during pregnancy vs. all unexposed women were first meta-analysed using a generic inverse variance method of analysis, followed by effect estimates for alternative pre-selected comparison groups. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies measuring ASD as an outcome (involving 3,585,686 children and 40,585 cases) and seven studies measuring ADHD as an outcome (involving 2,765,723 patients and 52,313 cases) were identified. Variation in confounding adjustment existed between studies. Updated effect estimates for the association between maternal antidepressant exposure during pregnancy vs. all unexposed women remained statistically significant for ASD (adjusted random-effects risk ratio [RaRR] 1.53, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-1.78). Similar significant associations were observed using pre-pregnancy maternal antidepressant exposure (RaRR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.29-1.71) and paternal antidepressant exposure during pregnancy (1.29, 95\% CI 1.08-1.53), but analyses restricted to using women with a history of affective disorder (1.18, 95\% CI 0.91-1.52) and sibling studies (0.96, 95\% CI 0.65-1.42) were not statistically significant. Corresponding associations for risk of ADHD with exposure were: RaRR 1.38, 95\% CI 1.13-1.69 (during pregnancy), RaRR 1.38, 95\% CI 1.14-1.69 (during pre-pregnancy), RaRR 1.71, 95\% CI 1.31-2.23 (paternal exposure), RaRR 0.98, 95\% CI 0.77-1.24 (women with a history of affective disorder) and RaRR 0.88, 95\% CI 0.70-1.11 (sibling studies). CONCLUSIONS: Existing observational studies measuring the risk of ASD and ADHD with antidepressant exposure are heterogeneous in their design. Classical comparisons between exposed and unexposed women during pregnancy are at high risk of residual confounding. Alternative comparisons and sibling designs may aid the interpretation of causality and their utility requires further evaluation, including understanding potential limitations of undertaking meta-analyses with such data.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Miscarriage is a common complication encountered during pregnancy. The role of progesterone in preparing the uterus for the implantation of the embryo and its role in maintaining the pregnancy have been known for a long time. Inadequate secretion of progesterone in early pregnancy has been linked to the aetiology of miscarriage and progesterone supplementation has been used as a treatment for threatened miscarriage to prevent spontaneous pregnancy loss. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and the safety of progestogens in the treatment of threatened miscarriage. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (December 2009) and bibliographies of all located articles for any unidentified articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials that compare progestogen with placebo, no treatment or any other treatment given in an effort to treat threatened miscarriage. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two authors assessed the trials for inclusion in the review and extracted the data. MAIN RESULTS: Two studies (84 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. In one study, all the participants met the inclusion criteria and in the other study, only the subgroup of participants who met the inclusion criteria was included in the meta-analysis. There was no evidence of effectiveness with the use vaginal progesterone compared to placebo in reducing the risk of miscarriage (risk ratio 0.47; 95\% confidence interval 0.17 to 1.30). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on scarce data from two methodologically poor trials, there is no evidence to support the routine use of progestogens for the treatment of threatened miscarriage. Information about potential harms to the mother or child, or both, with the use of progestogens is lacking. Further, larger, randomized controlled trials on the effect of progestogens on the treatment of threatened miscarriage, which investigate potential harms as well as benefits, are needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Historically, oestrogen and progesterone were each commonly used to save threatened pregnancies. In the 1940s it was postulated that their combined use would be synergistic and thereby led to the rationale of combined therapy for women who risked miscarriage. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and safety of combined oestrogen and progesterone therapy to prevent miscarriage. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (23 June 2013) CENTRAL (OVID) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 6 of 12), MEDLINE (OVID) (1946 to June Week 2 2013), OLDMEDLINE (1946 to 1965), Embase (1974 to Week 25 2013), Embase Classic (1947 to 1973), CINAHL (1994 to 23 June 2013) and reference lists of retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of combined oestrogen and progesterone for preventing miscarriage. We included one stratified randomised trial and one quasi-randomised trials. Cluster-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion but none were identified. We excluded studies published only as abstracts.We included studies that compared oestrogen and progesterone versus placebo or no intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed trial quality. Two review authors extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials (281 pregnancies and 282 fetuses) met our inclusion criteria. However, the two trials had significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity such that a meta-analysis combining trial data was considered inappropriate.One trial (involving 161 pregnancies) was based on women with a history of diabetes. It showed no statistically significant difference between using combined oestrogen and progestogen and using placebo for all our proposed primary outcomes, namely, miscarriage (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 2.80), perinatal death (RR 0.94, 95\% CI 0.53 to 1.69) and preterm birth (less than 34 weeks of gestation) (RR 0.91, 95\% CI 0.80 to 1.04). In terms of this review's secondary outcomes, use of combined oestrogen and progestogen was associated with an increased risk of maternal cancer in the reproductive system (RR 6.65, 95\% CI 1.56 to 28.29). However, for the outcome of cancer other than that of the reproductive system in mothers, there was no difference between groups. Similarly, there were no differences between the combined oestrogen and progestogen group versus placebo for other secondary outcomes reported: low birthweight of less than 2500 g, genital abnormalities in the offspring, abnormalities other than genital tract in the offspring, cancer in the reproductive system in the offspring, or cancer other than of the reproductive system in the offspring.The second study was based on pregnant women who had undergone in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). This study showed no difference in the rate of miscarriage between the combined oestrogen and progesterone group and the no treatment group (RR 0.66, 95\% CI 0.23 to 1.85). The study did not report on this review's other primary outcomes (perinatal death or rates of preterm birth), nor on any of our proposed secondary outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is an insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to assess the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone for preventing miscarriages. We strongly recommend further research in this area.},

We used within-woman differences between menstrual cycles in urinary hormone measurements from women in the North Carolina Early Pregnancy Study to describe hormonal changes after very early pregnancy loss (n = 28 early losses; 80 non-conception comparison cycles). We found lower pre-ovulatory luteinising hormone and shorter luteal phase length after very early pregnancy loss, but the differences were non-significant (p {\textgreater} 0.3) and smaller than those reported in the spontaneous miscarriage literature. Consistent with the reduced pituitary function reported post-spontaneous miscarriage, we found a slower rate of oestrogen rise (p = 0.08). There was no evidence of lower mid-luteal steroid levels as has been suggested for post-spontaneous miscarriage cycles. Very early pregnancy losses do not appear to influence subsequent menstrual cycles to the same degree as spontaneous miscarriages.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of cycle day 28 estradiol (E2) levels in predicting pregnancy outcomes after IVF. DESIGN: Retrospective, cohort study. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENT(S): All IVF cycles resulting in a positive pregnancy test result at our center between January 2007 and December 2012 were included. INTERVENTION(S): In vitro fertilization with fresh embryo transfer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): A total of 5,471 IVF cycles were identified. Cycles were stratified by day-28 E2 level (pg/mL) into three groups: A: {\textless}/=50; B: 51-100; and C: {\textgreater}100. Outcomes measured were live birth, clinical pregnancy, biochemical, ectopic, and spontaneous abortion rates. RESULT(S): There were 806, 588, and 4,077 IVF pregnancies in groups A, B, and C, respectively. Live birth rates were lower in groups A (15.4\%) and B (41.2\%) compared with group C (77.4\%), representing decreased odds of live birth in patients with E2 levels of {\textless}/=50 pg/mL (odd ratio 0.05, 95\% confidence interval 0.04-0.07) and in patients with levels of 51-100 pg/mL (odds ratio 0.20, 95\% confidence interval 0.17-0.25) compared with patients with levels {\textgreater}100 pg/mL. Rates of biochemical and ectopic pregnancies were higher in groups A (66.5\%, 6.20\%) and B (30.7\%, 3.57\%) compared with group C (7.31\%, 0.66\%). An hCG level {\textless}50 mIU/mL was associated with increased odds of a biochemical pregnancy and decreased odds of a live birth. CONCLUSION(S): Low E2 levels early in IVF pregnancies are associated with poorer pregnancy outcomes. Estradiol can be used alone or in conjunction with hCG levels to predict the odds of a live birth.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To identify, appraise and summarize the current evidence regarding the efficacy of strategies aimed at improving assisted reproductive techniques in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of the standard medical databases was performed. The last electronic search was run in July 2015. The primary outcome measures were live birth/ongoing pregnancy and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). The secondary outcome measures were clinical pregnancy and miscarriage. RESULTS: We screened 1021 records and completely assessed 173, finally including 66 studies in the quantitative analysis. Many different interventions were assessed, however the overall quality of the studies was low. We observed moderate-quality evidence that there is no clinically relevant difference in live birth/ongoing pregnancy rates (relative risk (RR), 0.95 (95\% CI, 0.84-1.08)), or clinical pregnancy (RR, 1.02 (95\% CI, 0.91-1.15)) when comparing antagonist and agonist protocols for ovarian stimulation. Additionally, we found low-quality evidence that metformin improves live birth/ongoing pregnancy (RR, 1.28 (95\% CI, 1.01-1.63)) and clinical pregnancy rates (RR, 1.26 (95\% CI, 1.04-1.53)) when compared with placebo or no intervention. We further found low-quality evidence that there is no clinically relevant difference in live birth/ongoing pregnancy rates (RR, 1.03 (95\% CI, 0.80-1.34)) and clinical pregnancy rates (RR, 0.99 (95\% CI, 0.81-1.22)) when comparing human menopausal gonadotropin for inducing ovulation and artificial preparation with estradiol valerate for endometrial preparation for frozen embryo transfer (FET). Low-quality evidence suggests that mannitol compared with no intervention (RR, 0.54 (95\% CI, 0.39-0.77)) and antagonist protocols compared with agonist protocols (RR, 0.63 (95\% CI, 0.49-0.80)) reduce rates of OHSS. CONCLUSION: There is low- to moderate-quality evidence suggesting that antagonist protocols are preferable to agonist ones, because they reduce the incidence of OHSS without interfering with clinical pregnancy and live birth for women with PCOS. Additionally there is low-quality evidence pointing to a benefit of metformin supplementation on clinical pregnancy and live birth; and that ovulation induction and administration of estradiol seem to be equally effective for endometrial preparation before FET for women with PCOS. For all other interventions, the evidence is of very low quality, not allowing any meaningful conclusions to be drawn. Estrategias para mejorar el resultado de la reproduccion asistida en mujeres con sindrome de ovario poliquistico: revision sistematica y metaanalisis RESUMEN OBJETIVOS: Identificar, evaluar y resumir la evidencia actual sobre la eficacia de las estrategias para mejorar las tecnicas de reproduccion asistida en mujeres con sindrome de ovario poliquistico (SOP). METODOS: Se realizo una busqueda exhaustiva de literatura en las bases de datos medicas estandar. La ultima busqueda electronica se realizo en julio de 2015. Las medidas de resultado primarias fueron los nacimientos vivos/embarazos en curso y el sindrome de hiperestimulacion ovarica (SHO). Las medidas de resultado secundarias fueron el embarazo confirmado ecograficamente y el aborto. RESULTADOS: Se cribaron 1021 registros, de los que se evaluaron por completo 173, para finalmente incluir 66 estudios en el analisis cuantitativo. Aunque se evaluaron muchas intervenciones diferentes, en general la calidad de los estudios fue baja. Se observo evidencia de calidad moderada de que no hay diferencias relevantes clinicamente en las tasas de nacimientos vivos/embarazos en curso (riesgo relativo (RR): 0,95 (IC 95\%, 0,84-1,08)), o de embarazos confirmados ecograficamente (RR: 1,02 (IC 95\%, 0,91-1,15)), cuando se comparan los protocolos de antagonistas y agonistas para la estimulacion ovarica. Ademas, se encontro evidencia de baja calidad en que la metformina mejora las tasas de nacimientos vivos/embarazos en curso (RR: 1,28 (IC 95\%, 1,01-1,63)) y de embarazos confirmados ecograficamente (RR: 1,26 (IC 95\%, 1,04-1,53)) en comparacion con un placebo o la no intervencion. Se encontro tambien evidencia de baja calidad en que no hay diferencias relevantes clinicamente en las tasas de nacimientos vivos/embarazos en curso (RR: 1,03 (IC 95\%, 0,80-1,34)) y las tasas de embarazos confirmados ecograficamente (RR: 0,99 (IC 95\%, 0.81-1,22)) al comparar la gonadotropina menopausica humana para la induccion de la ovulacion y la preparacion artificial con el valerato de estradiol para preparar el endometrio para la transferencia de embriones congelados (TEC). La baja calidad de la evidencia sugiere que el manitol, en comparacion con la no intervencion (RR: 0,54 (IC 95\%, 0,39-0,77)), y los protocolos de antagonistas, en comparacion con los protocolos de agonistas (RR: 0,63 (IC 95\%, 0,49-0,80)), reducen las tasas de SHO. CONCLUSION: Hay evidencia de calidad baja a moderada que sugiere que los protocolos de antagonistas son preferibles a los de agonistas, ya que reducen la tasa de SHO sin interferir con el embarazo confirmado ecograficamente y los nacimientos vivos en las mujeres con SOP. Ademas, existe evidencia de baja calidad que indica un beneficio del uso de metformina como aporte suplementario en embarazos confirmados ecograficamente y en nacimientos vivos; y que la induccion de la ovulacion y la administracion de estradiol parecen ser igualmente eficaces para la preparacion del endometrio antes de la TEC en mujeres con SOP. Para el resto de procedimientos, la evidencia es de muy baja calidad, y por ello no permite extraer conclusiones importantes.},

In men, reductions in testosterone can trigger declines in muscle mass, bone mass, and in physical function. In women, the impact of the loss of sex hormones, such as estradiol, on bone is well elucidated, but evidence is limited on whether the loss of estradiol negatively affects muscle mass and physical function. However, deficiencies in multiple anabolic hormones have been shown to predict health status and longevity in older persons. Thus, consideration should be given as to whether targeted hormone replacement therapies may prove effective at treating clinical conditions, such as age-related sarcopenia, cancer cachexia, and/or acute or chronic illnesses. If initiated carefully in the appropriate clinical population, hormone replacement therapies in men and women may prevent and reverse muscle and bone loss and functional declines and perhaps promote healthy aging and longevity.},

	abstract = {Chronic hypertension in pregnancy is associated with increased rates of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes both acute and long term. These adverse outcomes are particularly seen in women with uncontrolled severe hypertension, in those with target organ damage, and in those who are noncompliant with prenatal visits. In addition, adverse outcomes are substantially increased in women who develop superimposed preeclampsia or abruptio placentae. Women with chronic hypertension should be evaluated either before conception or at time of first prenatal visit. Depending on this evaluation, they can be divided into categories of either "high risk" or "low risk" chronic hypertension. High-risk women should receive aggressive antihypertensive therapy and frequent evaluations of maternal and fetal well-being, and doctors should recommend lifestyle changes. In addition, these women are at increased risk for postpartum complications such as pulmonary edema, renal failure, and hypertensive encephalopathy for which they should receive aggressive control of blood pressure as well as close monitoring. In women with low-risk (essential uncomplicated) chronic hypertension, there is uncertainty regarding the benefits or risks of antihypertensive therapy. In my experience, the majority of these women will have good pregnancy outcomes without the use of antihypertensive medications. Antihypertensive agents are recommended and are widely used in these women despite absent evidence of either benefits or harm from this therapy. These recommendations are based on dogma and consensus rather than on scientific evidence. There is an urgent need to conduct randomized trials in women with mild chronic hypertension in pregnancy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy is contraindicated because of their association with an increased risk of fetopathy. In contrast, first-trimester use of ACE inhibitors has not been linked to adverse fetal outcomes. We conducted a study to assess the association between exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy only and the risk of congenital malformations. METHODS: We studied a cohort of 29,507 infants enrolled in Tennessee Medicaid and born between 1985 and 2000 for whom there was no evidence of maternal diabetes. We identified 209 infants with exposure to ACE inhibitors in the first trimester alone, 202 infants with exposure to other antihypertensive medications in the first trimester alone, and 29,096 infants with no exposure to antihypertensive drugs at any time during gestation. Major congenital malformations were identified from linked vital records and hospitalization claims during the first year of life and confirmed by review of medical records. RESULTS: Infants with only first-trimester exposure to ACE inhibitors had an increased risk of major congenital malformations (risk ratio, 2.71; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.72 to 4.27) as compared with infants who had no exposure to antihypertensive medications. In contrast, fetal exposure to other antihypertensive medications during only the first trimester did not confer an increased risk (risk ratio, 0.66; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.25 to 1.75). Infants exposed to ACE inhibitors were at increased risk for malformations of the cardiovascular system (risk ratio, 3.72; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.89 to 7.30) and the central nervous system (risk ratio, 4.39; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.37 to 14.02).

	abstract = {Multistate models are models of disease progression that, for a patient group, define multiple outcome events, each of which may affect the time to develop another outcome event. Multistate models are highly relevant for studies of patients with cirrhosis; both the classical perception of cirrhosis as either compensated or decompensated and the recent, more complex models of cirrhosis progression are multistate models. Therefore, researchers who conduct clinical studies of patients with cirrhosis must realize that most of their research questions assume a multistate disease model. Failure to do so can result in severely biased results and bad clinical decisions. The analyses that can be used to study disease progression in a multistate disease model may be called competing risks analysis, named after the competing risks disease model, which is the simplest multistate disease model. In this review article, we introduce multistate disease models and competing risks analysis and explain why the standard armamentarium of Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and Cox regression sometimes gives bad answers to good questions. We also use real data to answer typical research questions about the course of cirrhosis and illustrate biases resulting from inadequate methods. Finally, we suggest statistical software packages that are helpful and accessible to the clinician-researcher.},

	abstract = {Direct and indirect standardization procedures aim at comparing differences in health or in health care expenditures between subgroups of the population after controlling for observable morbidity differences. There is a close analogy between this problem and the issue of risk adjustment in health insurance. Traditional methods of risk adjustment are analogous to indirect standardization. They are equivalent to the so-called conditional egalitarian mechanism in social choice. In general, they do not remove incentives for risk selection, even if the effect of non-morbidity variables is correctly taken into account. A method of risk adjustment based on direct standardization does remove the incentives for risk selection, but at the cost of violating a neutrality condition, stating that insurers should receive the same premium subsidy for all members of the same risk group. Direct standardization is equivalent to the egalitarian-equivalent (or proportional) mechanism in social choice. The conflict between removing incentives for risk selection and neutrality is unavoidable if the health expenditure function is not additively separable in the morbidity and efficiency variables.},

STUDY DESIGN: A population-based cohort study in an unselected cohort nulliparous women (N = 3464) in 'The Zaanstreek' district, The Netherlands. Risk stratification is part of routine care, where midwives cover all obstetrical care for women with low risk pregnancies. RESULTS: The incidence of standard PPH ({\textgreater} or = 500 ml) and severe PPH ({\textgreater} or = 1000 ml) were 19 and 4.2\%, respectively. A retained placenta occurred in 1.8\%. These data show consistently slightly higher values as compared to studies in literature. The most important risk factors for standard and severe PPH were related to an abnormal third stage of labour-third stage {\textgreater} or = 30 min and retained placenta (in severe PPH: odds ratio (OR) 14.1, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 10.4-19.1). High birth weight and perineal damage were less important, but independent, significant risk factors. In the low risk group (N = 1416), incidence of severe PPH was 4.0\%. Independent risk factors for severe PPH were third stage {\textgreater} or = 30 min (incidence 7.1\%, OR 3.6) and retained placenta (incidence 1.2\%, OR 21.6). In 25\% of the women with a prolonged third stage ({\textgreater} or = 30 min), third stage was complicated due to retained placenta and/or severe PPH (1.8\% of the low risk group). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of PPH in nulliparous women in this cohort was on average higher than published data, while the most important risk factors for standard and severe PPH, even after risk stratification, were the same. A prolonged third stage of labour has to be considered as abnormal, requiring specific action.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To examine risk factors and interventions associated with major primary postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) unresponsive to first-line conventional therapy. METHODS: From computerized maternity database, we identified women with major primary PPH defined as blood loss {\textgreater}or=1,000 ml and/or the need for a blood transfusion within 24 h of delivery beyond 24 weeks' gestation. Cases were assigned according to the mode of delivery and response to the first-line therapy (responders and non-responders). RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2002, 20,610 women delivered after 24 weeks' gestation. A total of 306 women developed primary PPH (14.8/1,000 deliveries) including 103 vaginal and 203 caesarean (CS) births. Out of 103 women with PPH following vaginal birth, 22 (21\%) failed to respond to first-line therapy. Following CS, 20 of 203 (10\%) failed first line treatment and required examination under anesthesia (EUA) and other interventions to control bleeding. Irrespective of the mode of delivery, antepartum risk factors did not differ between responders and non-responders to first-line therapy. In the vaginal group, non-responders were treated with required bimanual compression and intra-myometrial PGF(2)alpha (49\%), repair of cervical tear (14\%), vaginal packing (9\%), and uterine packing (5\%). In the CS group, hysterectomy was the most common surgical intervention (54\%) after other methods including uterine packing, B-Lynch procedure, uterine tamponade, and intra-myometrial prostaglandin were ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: The currently known risk factors for primary PPH are not useful in the identification of patients who continue to bleed after first-line therapy. Emergency hysterectomy was the most common surgical intervention used to control major PPH unresponsive to conventional therapy following CS birth.},

Direct deaths decreased from 6.24 per 100,000 maternities in 2003-2005 to 4.67 per 100,000 maternities in 2006-2008 (p = 0.02). This decline is predominantly due to the reduction in deaths from thromboembolism and, to a lesser extent, haemorrhage. For the first time there has been a reduction in the inequalities gap, with a significant decrease in maternal mortality rates among those living in the most deprived areas and those in the lowest socio-economic group. Despite a decline in the overall UK maternal mortality rate, there has been an increase in deaths related to genital tract sepsis, particularly from community acquired Group A streptococcal disease. The mortality rate related to sepsis increased from 0.85 deaths per 100,000 maternities in 2003-2005 to 1.13 deaths in 2006-2008, and sepsis is now the most common cause of Direct maternal death. Cardiac disease is the most common cause of Indirect death; the Indirect maternal mortality rate has not changed significantly since 2003-2005. This Confidential Enquiry identified substandard care in 70\% of Direct deaths and 55\% of Indirect deaths. Many of the identified avoidable factors remain the same as those identified in previous Enquiries. Recommendations for improving care have been developed and are highlighted in this report.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Primary postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is one of the top five causes of maternal mortality in both developed and developing countries. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of any intervention used for the treatment of primary PPH. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 August 2013). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing any interventions for the treatment of primary PPH. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We assessed studies for eligibility and quality and extracted data independently. We contacted authors of the included studies to request more information. MAIN RESULTS: Ten randomised clinical trials (RCTs) with a total of 4052 participants fulfilled our inclusion criteria and were included in this review.Four RCTs (1881 participants) compared misoprostol with placebo given in addition to conventional uterotonics. Adjunctive use of misoprostol (in the dose of 600 to 1000 mcg) with simultaneous administration of additional uterotonics did not provide additional benefit for our primary outcomes including maternal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 6.16, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 50.85), serious maternal morbidity (RR 0.34, 95\% CI 0.01 to 8.31), admission to intensive care (RR 0.79, 95\% CI 0.30 to 2.11) or hysterectomy (RR 0.93, 95\% CI 0.16 to 5.41). Two RCTs (1787 participants) compared 800 mcg sublingual misoprostol versus oxytocin infusion as primary PPH treatment; one trial included women who had received prophylactic uterotonics, and the other did not. Primary outcomes did not differ between the two groups, although women given sublingual misoprostol were more likely to have additional blood loss of at least 1000 mL (RR 2.65, 95\% CI 1.04 to 6.75). Misoprostol was associated with a significant increase in vomiting and shivering.Two trials attempted to test the effectiveness of estrogen and tranexamic acid, respectively, but were too small for any meaningful comparisons of pre-specified outcomes.One study compared lower segment compression but was too small to assess impact on primary outcomes.We did not identify any trials evaluating surgical techniques or radiological interventions for women with primary PPH unresponsive to uterotonics and/or haemostatics. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Clinical trials included in the current review were not adequately powered to assess impact on the primary outcome measures. Compared with misoprostol, oxytocin infusion is more effective and causes fewer side effects when used as first-line therapy for the treatment of primary PPH. When used after prophylactic uterotonics, misoprostol and oxytocin infusion worked similarly. The review suggests that among women who received oxytocin for the treatment of primary PPH, adjunctive use of misoprostol confers no added benefit.The role of tranexamic acid and compression methods requires further evaluation. Furthermore, future studies should focus on the best way to treat women who fail to respond to uterotonic therapy.},

The prevalence of PPH and SPPH is approximately 6\% and 1.86\% of all deliveries, respectively, with a wide variation across regions of the world.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Following the results of the Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths report, which claims two maternal deaths annually in the UK from postpartum haemorrhage, our aim was to assess the accuracy of 'visual estimation of blood loss' and produce suitable pictorial and written algorithms to aid in the recognition and management of massive obstetric haemorrhage. DESIGN: Observational study to determine discrepancy between actual blood loss (ABL) and estimated blood loss (EBL). SETTING: Teaching hospital. POPULATION: Hundred and three obstetricians, anaesthetists, midwives, nurses and healthcare assistants. METHODS: Clinical scenarios were reproduced in the form of 12 Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) style stations augmented with known volumes of whole blood. Individual staff estimated the blood loss visually and recorded their results. Digital photographs were used to produce a pictorial 'algorithm' suitable for use as a teaching tool in labour ward. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Areas of greatest discrepancy between EBL and ABL. RESULTS: Significant underestimation of the ABL occurred in 5 of the 12 OSCE stations: 500-ml (50-cm diameter) floor spill, 1000-ml (75-cm diameter) floor spill, 1500-ml (100-cm diameter) floor spill, 350-ml capacity of soaked 45- x 45-cm large swab and the 2-l vaginal postpartum haemorrhage on bed/floor. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate visual estimation of blood loss is known to facilitate timely resuscitation, minimising the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation and reducing the severity of haemorrhagic shock. Participation in clinical reconstructions may encourage early diagnosis and prompt treatment of postpartum haemorrhage. Written and pictorial guidelines may help all staff working in labour wards.},

The cEBL was derived by multiplying the calculated pregnancy blood volume (0.75 x \{[maternal height (inches) x 50] + [maternal weight in pounds x 25]\}) by percent of blood volume lost (\{predelivery HCT - postdelivery HCT\}/predelivery HCT). cEBL and vEBL were compared according to mode of delivery and degree of perineal laceration. RESULTS: There were 677 subjects with complete data. vEBL was statistically different from cEBL between each degree of laceration and between all modes of delivery, demonstrating an underestimation of vEBL with increasing cEBL.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cause of a recent increase in hysterectomies for postpartum haemorrhage in Canada. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Canada between 1991 and 2004. POPULATION: All hospital deliveries in Canada as documented in the database of the Canadian Institute for Health Information (excluding incomplete data from Quebec, Manitoba and Nova Scotia). METHODS: Deliveries with postpartum haemorrhage by subtype were identified using International Classification of Diseases codes, while hysterectomies were identified using procedure codes. Changes in determinants of postpartum haemorrhage (all postpartum haemorrhage and that requiring hysterectomy) were examined, and crude and adjusted period changes were assessed using logistic models. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postpartum haemorrhage, postpartum haemorrhage with hysterectomy, postpartum haemorrhage with blood transfusion and postpartum haemorrhage by subtype. RESULTS: Rates of postpartum haemorrhage increased from 4.1\% in 1991 to 5.1\% in 2004 (23\% increase, 95\% CI 20-26\%), while rates of postpartum haemorrhage with hysterectomy increased from 24.0 in 1991 to 41.7 per 100,000 deliveries in 2004 (73\% increase, 95\% CI 27-137\%). These increases were because of an increase in atonic postpartum haemorrhage, from 29.4 per 1000 deliveries in 1991 to 39.5 per 1000 deliveries in 2004 (34\% increase, 95\% CI 31-38\%). Adjustment for temporal changes in risk factors did not explain the increase in atonic postpartum haemorrhage but attenuated the increase in atonic postpartum haemorrhage with hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a recent, unexplained increase in the frequency, and possibly the severity, of atonic postpartum haemorrhage in Canada.},

STUDY POPULATION: The database includes all hospital births in Denmark. MAIN VARIABLES: Anesthesia/pain relief, continuous support for women in the delivery room, lacerations (third and fourth degree), cesarean section, postpartum hemorrhage, establishment of skin-to-skin contact between the mother and the newborn infant, severe fetal hypoxia (proportion of live-born children with neonatal hypoxia), delivery of a healthy child after an uncomplicated birth, and anesthesia in case of cesarean section. DESCRIPTIVE DATA: Data have been collected since 2010. As of August 2015, data on women and children representing 269,597 births and 274,153 children have been collected. All data for the DNQDB is collected from the Danish Medical Birth Registry. Registration to the Danish Medical Birth Registry is mandatory for all maternity units in Denmark. During the 5 years, performance has improved in the areas covered by the process indicators and for some of the outcome indicators. CONCLUSION: Measuring quality of care during childbirth has inspired and enabled staff to attend to the quality of the care they provide and has led to improvements in most of the areas covered.},

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study, prospectively collected information. SETTING: Stavanger University Hospital, a secondary referral center, Norway. POPULATION: An unselected population of 41,365 women giving birth at the hospital. METHODS: We analyzed changes over time in mean postpartum hemorrhage, severe postpartum hemorrhage and associated factors. Estimated blood loss {\textgreater}1,000 ml was defined as severe hemorrhage. Data were collected from the hospital's database. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Severe postpartum hemorrhage and obstetric interventions. RESULTS: We observed an increase in severe hemorrhage during the study period. After cesarean sections, the risk of severe hemorrhage was twice the risk of severe hemorrhage after vaginal deliveries (5.9\%; 95\% CI 5.3-6.6 vs. 2.8\%; 95\% CI 2.6-2.9). The most important factors associated with severe hemorrhage following vaginal deliveries were twin deliveries (OR 6.8), retained placenta (OR 3.9) and inductions of labor (OR 2.2). For cesarean sections, twin deliveries had the strongest association with severe hemorrhage (OR 3.7) followed by general anesthesia (OR 3.0). Obstetric interventions became more frequent; elective cesarean sections increased from 2.4 to 4.9\%, acute cesarean sections from 5.5 to 8.9\%, operative vaginal deliveries from 9.3 to 12.5\%, inductions of labor from 14.3 to 15.8\% and augmentations of labor from 5.8 to 29.3\%.

RESULTS: In the total population the crude transfusion rates for women with planned caesarean delivery and intended vaginal delivery were 2.24 and 1.75\%. After adjustment for maternal age, body mass index, birthweight, smoking, parity, number of infants and previous caesarean delivery, the risk of red blood cell transfusion was significantly lower in women with planned caesarean delivery compared with intended vaginal delivery (odds ratio 0.82; 95\% CI 0.73-0.92; P {\textless} 0.01). In low-risk nulliparous women and in women with a previous caesarean delivery the transfusion rates were lower for planned caesarean delivery compared with intended vaginal delivery before and after adjustment.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. Several recent publications have noted an increasing trend in incidence over time. The international PPH collaboration was convened to explore the observed trends and to set out actions to address the factors identified. METHODS: We reviewed available data sources on the incidence of PPH over time in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, the United Kingdom and the USA. Where information was available, the incidence of PPH was stratified by cause. RESULTS: We observed an increasing trend in PPH, using heterogeneous definitions, in Australia, Canada, the UK and the USA. The observed increase in PPH in Australia, Canada and the USA was limited solely to immediate/atonic PPH. We noted increasing rates of severe adverse outcomes due to hemorrhage in Australia, Canada, the UK and the USA. CONCLUSION: Key Recommendations 1. Future revisions of the International Classification of Diseases should include separate codes for atonic PPH and PPH immediately following childbirth that is due to other causes. Also, additional codes are required for placenta accreta/percreta/increta. 2. Definitions of PPH should be unified; further research is required to investigate how definitions are applied in practice to the coding of data. 3. Additional improvement in the collection of data concerning PPH is required, specifically including a measure of severity. 4. Further research is required to determine whether an increased rate of reported PPH is also observed in other countries, and to further investigate potential risk factors including increased duration of labor, obesity and changes in second and third stage management practice. 5. Training should be provided to all staff involved in maternity care concerning assessment of blood loss and the monitoring of women after childbirth. This is key to reducing the severity of PPH and preventing any adverse outcomes. 6. Clinicians should be more vigilant given the possibility that the frequency and severity of PPH has in fact increased. This applies particularly to small hospitals with relatively few deliveries where management protocols may not be defined adequately and drugs or equipment may not be on hand to deal with unexpected severe PPH.},

It contains information on maternal age provided by the Civil Registration System. Information on pre-pregnancy body mass index and smoking in first trimester is collected in early pregnancy (first antenatal visit). The individual-level data can be linked to other Danish health registers such as the National Patient Registry and the Danish National Prescription Registry.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Both venous thromboembolism (VTE) and high plasma vitamin B12 levels (cobalamin, Cbl) are markers of occult cancer and aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis. In this population-based cohort study, we assessed VTE risk among cancer patients with high plasma Cbl levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used Danish health registries to identify a Cb1 cohort of 25,310 cancer patients with a plasma Cbl measurement prior to cancer diagnosis. The cohort was subdivided according to Cbl levels (pmol/L): 200-600 (population reference range), 601-800 and {\textgreater}800. All VTE events were considered provoked and categorised as either cancer-associated if no other provoking factors were present before VTE or provoked by other risk factors (surgery, trauma, or pregnancy). We calculated cumulative incidence proportions and adjusted hazard ratios computed from Cox regression analysis (reference: plasma Cbl of 200-600pmol/L) for the risk of VTE before and after the cancer diagnosis date (index date). RESULTS: The risk of cancer-associated VTE 30days after index date increased with higher Cbl levels. The cumulative incidence (95\% CI) by Cbl levels was: 200-600pmol/L: 0.24 (0.18-0.31); 601-800pmol/L: 0.63 (0.34-1.09); {\textgreater}800pmol/L: 0.86 (0.49-1.40). Adjusted hazard ratios (95\% CI) were: 601-800 vs. 200-600: 2.55 (1.32-4.92); {\textgreater}800 vs. 200-600: 2.36 (1.19-4.71). We found similar results for VTE provoked by other risk factors and for VTE occurring before index date, but scarcity of events produced uncertain risk estimates. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated an association between high plasma Cbl levels and risk of VTE in cancer patients. Any clinical implications warrant further study.},

	abstract = {A population case-control study was used to determine risk factors for excessive and/or prolonged vaginal bleeding (described collectively as vaginal loss problems) and uterine infection from 24 h to 3 months postpartum. Data were obtained from women whose maternity care took place in one of two health districts in the south of England. The cases were women remaining in or admitted to hospital with excessive or prolonged vaginal blood loss from 24 h to 3 months postpartum. Two controls for each case were identified; these were women whose delivery was the nearest in time and in the same location as the case delivery. Medical and midwifery records were searched retrospectively to cover hospital admissions for vaginal blood loss problems or uterine infection in postpartum women from 1 January 1994 to 31 December 1995. Data were analysed for 243 cases and 486 controls. Univariable analysis identified 28 variables associated with being a case. Using multivariable analysis, nine factors remained in the final model, with a history of secondary postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) being the most strongly predictive (OR [95\% confidence interval] 6.0 [2.1, 16.8]). Vaginal bleeding prior to 24 weeks' gestation (OR 3.0 [1.6, 5.9]), third trimester hospital admission (OR 2.0 [1.4, 2.8]), maternal smoking (OR 2.7 [1.8, 3.9]), a prolonged (OR 3.1 [1.2, 7.5]) or incomplete third stage (OR 2.1 [1.0, 4.4]), and primary PPH (OR 4.7 [1.9, 11.6]) for blood loss {\textgreater}500 mL, were predictive of becoming a case. No significant association was identified for parity (OR 1.1 [0.8, 1.5]) or method of delivery, spontaneous (OR 1.0 [0.7, 1.3]), instrumental (OR 1.4 [0.9, 2.2]) or operative (OR 1.2 [0.8, 1.9]). This is a neglected area of women's health after childbirth, and the value of this study is in the identification of potential risk factors for postpartum morbidity related to vaginal blood loss. Where morbidity occurs, early diagnosis, management and treatment are likely to reduce its extent or duration. It is considered that raising awareness about these factors, both among healthcare professionals and women themselves, may play an important part in the recognition and treatment of postpartum morbidity.},

Her uterus was intact and gynecological examination after delivery was normal without any potential signs or symptoms of pathology. However, the day following her labor, patient complained of left iliac fossa pain. Her blood tests revealed a CRP value at 27.6 mg/L, whereas the X-rays revealed an extensive impacted fecal mass in the colon. MRI revealed that the left lower myometrial part of the uterus was depicted abrupt, with simultaneous presence of hemorrhagic stuff. The decision of laparotomy was therefore made in order to further evaluate rupture of uterus and properly treat patient. And subtotal hysterectomy was performed.

STUDY DESIGN: Approximately 10,700 infants and their parents were included in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort in 2001-2002. Research staff collected data in 5 waves when participating children were approximately 9 months and 2, 4, 5, and 6 years of age. We analyzed 2950 LGA and appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) children with at least 1 growth outcome at ages 9 months, 2 years, and 4 years. We divided 600 LGA newborns into 8 subgroups by maternal overweight or obesity before pregnancy (OW/OB), diabetes mellitus (DM), and excessive gestational weight gain (ExGWG). We used mixed effect regression models to compare trajectories of height (length)-for-age or body mass index (BMI) z scores across LGA subgroups and the AGA reference group. RESULTS: Relative to the reference group, the LGA subgroup with maternal OW/OB and DM but normal gestational weight gain had "continuous high rising" BMI z-score trajectory from 9 months to 4 years and the greatest mean z score at 4 years (2.14 [95\% CI, 1.29, 2.98]). The LGA subgroup free of maternal OW/OB, DM, or ExGWG had a similar BMI z-score trajectory ("stable low") from 9 months to 4 years and a similar 4-years mean z score (0.97 [95\% CI, 0.75, 1.18] vs 0.72 [95\% CI, 0.67, 0.78]) relative to the AGA reference group. CONCLUSIONS: The LGA subgroup with co-occurrence of maternal OW/OB and DM had the greatest 4-year BMI, whereas the LGA subgroup free of maternal OW/OB, DM, or ExGWG were tall but lean ("a healthy phenotype").},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The association between lower-extremity venous thrombosis and cancer is well-established. However, the extent to which upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis (U-DVT) is a marker of cancer and a prognostic factor for all-cause mortality remains poorly understood. We examined the risk of cancer after a diagnosis of U-DVT compared with cancer risk in the general population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Danish nationwide population-based medical registries, we identified all patients with first-time U-DVT during 1980-1993 and 2000-2013. Cancer incidence was ascertained using data from the Danish Cancer Registry. We computed standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) calculated as the observed number of cancers relative to the expected number based on national incidence rates by sex, age, and calendar year. We created a matched comparison cohort of cancer patients without U-DVT, to assess the impact of U-DVT on all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Among 1087 patients with U-DVT, 232 patients subsequently were diagnosed with cancer, corresponding to an overall SIR of 1.69 (95\% confidence interval, 1.48-1.92). During the first 6months following U-DVT, the absolute risk of any cancer was 5.4\%, corresponding to a 13-fold elevated SIR. During the subsequent 6-12months and {\textgreater}12months, the SIR remained 2-fold and 1.3-fold elevated, respectively. U-DVT was a prognostic factor for all-cause mortality in patients with lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer during the first 6months of follow-up. CONCLUSION: U-DVT was a marker of cancer. The clinical utility of searching for occult cancer in patients with U-DVT remains unknown.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The principal objective of our study was to describe the frequency of severe secondary postpartum hemorrhages (PPH). Our secondary objectives were to describe the different causes of PPH and to assess if the PPH etiologies varied by parity. METHODS: This is a historical cohort study covering the period from January 1, 2004, through February 13, 2013, in a level III maternity ward. Women were eligible if they were treated for severe secondary PPH during their postpartum hospitalization or were admitted for it after discharge but before the 42nd day postpartum, regardless of the type of delivery. Women were excluded if they gave birth before 22 weeks of gestation or if they had experienced only an immediate PPH ({\textless}/= 24 hours after delivery). Eligible patients were identified by the hospital's administrative software. Primiparas and multiparas were compared with Student's t test and a chi-squared or Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: The incidence of severe secondary PPH was 0.23 percent (n = 60/26,023). The mean time between delivery and PPH onset was 13.4 +/- 10.8 days. The women's mean age was 30.4 +/- 5.7 years and their mean body mass index was 23.4 +/- 5.7 kg/m(2). Placental retention was the cause to which these hemorrhages were most frequently attributed (30.0\%). Subinvolution of the placental bed was noted in 13.3 percent of the patients, endometritis in 10.0 percent, pseudoaneurysm of the uterine artery in 3.3 percent, and excessively strong resumption of menses in 3.3 percent; no cause could be determined for 16.7 percent of the cases. Neither clinical signs nor causes differed by parity. CONCLUSION: Secondary PPH is rare. Accurate diagnosis is based most often on histopathologic findings.},

	abstract = {Maternal hemorrhage, defined as a cumulative blood loss of greater than or equal to 1,000 mL or blood loss accompanied by signs or symptoms of hypovolemia within 24 hours after the birth process, remains the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide (1). Additional important secondary sequelae from hemorrhage exist and include adult respiratory distress syndrome, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute renal failure, loss of fertility, and pituitary necrosis (Sheehan syndrome).Hemorrhage that leads to blood transfusion is the leading cause of severe maternal morbidity in the United States closely followed by disseminated intravascular coagulation (2). In the United States, the rate of postpartum hemorrhage increased 26\% between 1994 and 2006 primarily because of increased rates of atony (3). In contrast, maternal mortality from postpartum obstetric hemorrhage has decreased since the late 1980s and accounted for slightly more than 10\% of maternal mortalities (approximately 1.7 deaths per 100,000 live births) in 2009 (2, 4). This observed decrease in mortality is associated with increasing rates of transfusion and peripartum hysterectomy (2-4).The purpose of this Practice Bulletin is to discuss the risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage as well as its evaluation, prevention, and management. In addition, this document will encourage obstetrician-gynecologists and other obstetric care providers to play key roles in implementing standardized bundles of care (eg, policies, guidelines, and algorithms) for the management of postpartum hemorrhage.},

STUDY DESIGN: A comparison between consecutive singleton deliveries with and without early PPH was performed. Deliveries occurred during the years 1988-2002 in a tertiary medical center. A multivariate logistic regression model was constructed in order to define independent risk factors for PPH. RESULTS: Postpartum hemorrhage complicated 0.4\% (n = 666) of all deliveries enrolled in the study (n = 154 311). Significant risk factors for PPH, identified using a multivariable analysis, were: retained placenta (OR 3.5, 95\%CI 2.1-5.8), failure to progress during the second stage of labor (OR 3.4, 95\%CI 2.4-4.7), placenta accreta (OR 3.3, 95\%CI 1.7-6.4), lacerations (OR 2.4, 95\%CI 2.0-2.8), instrumental delivery (OR 2.3, 95\%CI 1.6-3.4), large for gestational age (LGA) newborn (OR 1.9, 95\%CI 1.6-2.4), hypertensive disorders (OR 1.7, 95\%CI 1.2-2.1), induction of labor (OR 1.4, 95\%CI 1.1-1.7) and augmentation of labor with oxytocin (OR 1.4, 95\%CI 1.2-1.7). Women were assigned into three different groups according to the assessed severity of PPH, assuming that the severe cases were handled by revision of the birth canal under anesthesia, and the most severe cases required in addition treatment with blood products. A significant linear association was found between the severity of bleeding and the following factors: vacuum extraction, oxytocin augmentation, hypertensive disorders as well as perinatal mortality, uterine rupture, peripartum hysterectomy and uterine or internal iliac artery ligation (p {\textless} 0.001 for all variables). CONCLUSION: Hypertensive disorder, failure to progress during the second stage of labor, oxytocin augmentation, vacuum extraction and LGA were found to be major risk factors for severe PPH. Special attention should be given after birth to hypertensive patients, and to patients who underwent induction of labor or instrumental delivery, as well as to those delivering LGA newborns.},

METHODS: All Danish women with a first and second delivery from January 2001 to September 2009 who gave birth in a hospital that reported transfusion of red blood cells to a national database: A total of 96 545 women were included. RESULTS: Retained placental tissue explained more than all other risk factors in vaginal deliveries. Retained placental tissue at first delivery was associated with postpartum transfusion at a second vaginal delivery, and may also be used as an early predictor in parallel with a history of either placental abruption, postpartum transfusion or caesarean delivery. The positive predictive values of having more than one risk factor was low (2.2\%-2.7\%). CONCLUSIONS: Prediction of postpartum transfusion is difficult. Retained placental tissue is the strongest predictor of postpartum blood transfusion in vaginal deliveries. Retained placental tissue is usually diagnosed for the first time when the bleeding starts, which limits the clinical value of prediction. We need tools for an early diagnosis of retained placenta to intervene early before transfusion is needed.},

DESIGN: Prospective, Nordic collaboration. SETTING: The Nordic Obstetric Surveillance Study (NOSS) collected cases of severe obstetric complications in the Nordic countries from April 2009 to August 2012. SAMPLE AND METHODS: Cases were reported by clinicians at the Nordic maternity units and retrieved from medical birth registers, hospital discharge registers, and transfusion databases by using International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision codes on diagnoses and the Nordic Medico-Statistical Committee Classification of Surgical Procedure codes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of the studied complications and possible risk factors among parturients in the Nordic countries. RESULTS: The studied complications were reported in 1019 instances among 605 362 deliveries during the study period. The reported rate of severe blood loss at delivery was 11.6/10 000 deliveries, complete uterine rupture was 5.6/10 000 deliveries, abnormally invasive placenta was 4.6/10 000 deliveries, and peripartum hysterectomy was 3.5/10 000 deliveries. Of the women, 25\% had two or more complications. Women with complications were more often {\textgreater}35 years old, overweight, with a higher parity, and a history of cesarean delivery compared with the total population. CONCLUSION: The studied obstetric complications are rare. Uniform definitions and valid reporting are essential for international comparisons. The main risk factors include previous cesarean section.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) remains a leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. In Denmark 2\% of parturients receive blood transfusion. During the course of bleeding fibrinogen (coagulation factor I) may be depleted and fall to critically low levels, impairing haemostasis and thus worsening the ongoing bleeding. A plasma level of fibrinogen below 2 g/L in the early phase of postpartum haemorrhage is associated with subsequent development of severe haemorrhage. Use of fibrinogen concentrate allows high-dose substitution without the need for blood type crossmatch. So far no publications of randomised controlled trials involving acutely bleeding patients in the obstetrical setting have been published. This trial aims to investigate if early treatment with fibrinogen concentrate reduces the need for blood transfusion in women suffering severe PPH. METHODS/DESIGN: In this randomised placebo-controlled double-blind multicentre trial, parturients with primary PPH are eligible following vaginal delivery in case of: manual removal of placenta (blood loss {\textgreater}/= 500 ml) or manual exploration of the uterus after the birth of placenta (blood loss {\textgreater}/= 1000 ml). Caesarean sections are also eligible in case of perioperative blood loss {\textgreater}/= 1000 ml. The exclusion criteria are known inherited haemostatic deficiencies, prepartum treatment with antithrombotics, pre-pregnancy weight {\textless}45 kg or refusal to receive blood transfusion. Following informed consent, patients are randomly allocated to either early treatment with 2 g fibrinogen concentrate or 100 ml isotonic saline (placebo). Haemostatic monitoring with standard laboratory coagulation tests and thromboelastography (TEG, functional fibrinogen and Rapid TEG) is performed during the initial 24 hours.Primary outcome is the need for blood transfusion. To investigate a 33\% reduction in the need for blood transfusion, a total of 245 patients will be included. Four university-affiliated public tertiary care hospitals will include patients during a two-year period. Adverse events including thrombosis are assessed in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) good clinical practice (GCP). DISCUSSION: A widespread belief in the benefits of early fibrinogen substitution in cases of PPH has led to increased off-label use. The FIB-PPH trial is investigator-initiated and aims to provide an evidence-based platform for the recommendations of the early use of fibrinogen concentrate in PPH.

We conducted a meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies to examine this relation. METHODS: A systematic literature search up to June of 2007 was performed in MEDLINE and EMBASE. Study-specific risk estimates were pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Ten prospective and 24 case-control studies were included in the analysis of the effect of ever smoking. Ever smoking was statistically significantly associated with a reduced risk of endometrial cancer among prospective studies (relative risk 0.81; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-0.88) and case-control studies (odds ratio 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.66-0.79). The inverse association was significant among current and former smokers. Six prospective and 6 case-control studies were included in the quantitative analysis. We noted that an increase in smoking of 20 cigarettes per day was statistically significantly associated with 16\% and 27\% reduced risks of endometrial cancer in prospective and case-control studies, respectively. We also found that cigarette smoking was significantly associated with a decreased risk of endometrial cancer among postmenopausal women (relative risk 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.65-0.78) but not among premenopausal women. In addition, the risk reduction seemed to be stronger among hormone replacement therapy users than nonusers. CONCLUSION: Cigarette smoking was found to be significantly associated with a reduced risk of endometrial cancer, especially among postmenopausal women.},

METHODS: The clinical records of operative office hysteroscopic and resectoscopic procedures for endometrial polyps in 417 premenopausal women who attended Baskent University were examined over a retrospective period of 30 months. Only premenopausal patients were included in the study. RESULTS: In 97.8\% of women, histology showed benign endometrial pathology. In 2.2\% of women, pre-malignant or malignant conditions were found in the polyp. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and the presence of 2 or more polyps were associated with significant pre-malignant or malignant changes. CONCLUSION: The presence of irregular vaginal bleeding was not a predictor of malignancy in the polyp. Premenopausal women with PCOS and those with 2 or more polyps had an increased prevalence of polyp malignancy. These groups of patients, whether symptomatic or not, should be evaluated by hysteroscopic resection of the polyps.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of premalignant and malignant lesions of symptomatic and asymptomatic endometrial polyps among premenopausal women and to verify whether different clinical parameters, and polyp volume and number are associated with a more precise estimate of malignancy. METHODS: One hundred and fifty women aged 29-52 years and with certain diagnosis of endometrial polyp were enrolled in a prospective observational study. The recruited patients underwent hysteroscopic polypectomy based on saline infusion sonohysterography and diagnostic hysteroscopy. Pathologic report was the main outcome. RESULTS: Among women with endometrial polyps, 62 \% had asymptomatic polyps. The prevalence of premalignant and malignant polyps comprised 4.6 \% of cases (3.3 \% hyperplasia with atypia and 1.3 \% carcinomatous polyps). The presence of abnormal uterine bleeding was not a predictor of premalignant and malignant changes in the polyp. On logistic regression analysis, the premalignant and malignant lesions were influenced by polycystic ovary syndrome (p {\textless} 0.001; OR 4.61; CI 1.9-27), polyp volume {\textgreater}10 ml (p {\textless} 0.001; OR 5.83; CI 4.31-9.17), and multiple polyps (p = 0. 01; OR 2.05; CI 1.09-3.76). Notably, the odds ratio of polyp volume {\textgreater}10 ml was 5.83. This additional risk confirms the importance of polyp volume in the detection of malignant transformation rather than associating bleeding in premenopausal women. CONCLUSION: Polycystic ovary syndrome, polyp volume greater than 10 ml, and increased polyp number represent the markers of risk for premalignant and malignant transformation of endometrial polyps in premenopausal women. Nonetheless, the majority of polyps are asymptomatic, and the risk of malignancy is very low. Therefore, for women with polyp volume {\textless}/=10 ml and no risk factors, a more expectant approach may be warranted in order to reduce surgical risks and costs.},

METHODS: All women undergoing hysteroscopic resection of endometrial polyps from January 1998 to December 2008 were selected using a computerized database from the operating theater of the Prof. Dr. Jose Aristodemo Pinotti Women's Hospital, Women's Health Care Center/University of Campinas. Eight hundred seventy women with ages ranging from 25 to 85 years were included. Polyps were classified into benign (endometrial polyps and polyps with nonatypical simple hyperplasia and nonatypical complex hyperplasia), premalignant (polyps with atypical simple hyperplasia or atypical complex hyperplasia), and malignant. Statistical analysis was performed by measurement of the frequencies, means, and SD. The risk factors for malignancy were assessed by bivariate and multiple regression analyses, using the Epi-Info 2000 program and SAS (Statistical Analysis Software), version 9.2. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the women was 57.5 (10.6) years. Of these women, 76.4\% were postmenopausal. Women were diagnosed with benign lesions in 95.8\% of cases. Premalignant polyps accounted for 1.6\% of the total number of cases. Malignant polyps represented 2.5\% of the total sample. Postmenopausal bleeding and age greater than 60 years were the only factors that remained associated with a higher risk of malignancy with a prevalence ratio of 3.67 (95\% CI, 1.69-7.97) and 1.5 (95\% CI, 1.01-1.09), respectively.

Similarly, the real complexity of the thought processes that lead to a scientific undertaking is almost never described in published papers. In this paper, we first discuss how to get an idea that is worth researching. We describe sources of new ideas and how to foster a creative attitude by "cultivating your thoughts". Only a few of these ideas will make it into a study. Next, we describe how to sharpen and focus a research question so that a study becomes feasible and a valid test of the underlying idea. To do this, the idea needs to be "pruned". Pruning a research question means cutting away anything that is unnecessary, so that only the essence remains. This includes determining both the latent and the stated objectives, specific pruning questions, and the use of specific schemes to structure reasoning. After this, the following steps include preparation of a brief protocol, conduct of a pilot study, and writing a draft of the paper including draft tables.

METHODS: Demographic and clinico-pathologic data were collected from the National Cancer Institute database between 1988 and 2001. Data were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Of the 51,471 women diagnosed with uterine cancer in the study period, 2,076 (4.0\%) patients were aged 40 years or younger, and 49,395 (96.0\%) were older than 40. The mean age in the younger group was 35.6 years, compared with 65.2 years of the older group. The overall distribution by stage was stage I 75.4\%, II 8.1\%, III 6.7\%, and IV 9.8\%. Younger patients were more likely to be nonwhite (42.4\% versus 18.3\%, P{\textless}.001) and have stage I disease (79.2\% versus 75.3\%, P{\textless}.001), grade 1 lesions (47.6\% versus 35.6\%, P{\textless}.001), and sarcomas (15.9\% versus 8.2\%, P{\textless}.001) compared with their older counterparts. The overall 5-year disease-specific survival for younger patients was significantly better than that of older women (93.2\% versus 86.4\%, P{\textless}.001). On multivariable analysis, younger age, earlier stage, lower grade, nonblack race, endometrioid histology, and surgical treatment remained as significant independent prognostic factors for improved survival. CONCLUSION: This large population-based study demonstrates that patients 40 years and younger have an overall survival advantage compared with women older than 40 years, independent of other clinico-pathologic prognosticators.

Endometrial cancer has increased 21\% in incidence since 2008, and the death rate has increased more than 100\% over the past two decades. Precursor lesions of complex hyperplasia with atypia are associated with an endometrial carcinoma in more than 40\% of cases. Endometrial cancer in white women occurs at twice the incidence as in black women, but, stage for stage, black women have a less favorable prognosis. Preoperative imaging cannot accurately assess lymph node involvement. Gross examination of depth of myometrial invasion does not have the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, or negative predictive value to select women who can have lymphadenectomy safely omitted from the surgical procedure. Although surgical staging remains the most accurate method of determining the extent of disease, the therapeutic value of pelvic lymphadenectomy has not been established. The anatomical extent of lymphadenectomy and the number of lymph nodes removed to establish prognostic and therapeutic benefit are controversial. Research efforts are directed at identifying women with early stage endometrial cancer who only require total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Minimally invasive surgical techniques have become established as standard therapy for treating women with endometrial cancer. Women with a family history of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer are at increased risk for endometrial cancer. Conservative treatment to allow for childbearing is possible in select situations.

We examined effect modification of this relationship and associations with tumor characteristics in the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study. METHODS: We examined the association between cigarette smoking and endometrial carcinoma risk among 110,304 women. During 1,029,041 person years of follow-up, we identified 1,476 incident endometrial carcinoma cases. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95 \% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between smoking status, years since smoking cessation, and endometrial carcinoma risk overall and within strata of endometrial carcinoma risk factors. Effect modification was assessed using likelihood ratio test statistics. Smoking associations by histologic subtype/grade and stage at diagnosis were also evaluated. RESULTS: Reduced endometrial carcinoma risk was evident among former (RR 0.89, 95 \% CI 0.80, 1.00) and current (RR 0.65, 95 \% CI 0.55, 0.78) smokers compared with never smokers. Smoking cessation 1-4 years prior to baseline was significantly associated with endometrial carcinoma risk (RR 0.65, 95 \% CI 0.48, 0.89), while cessation {\textgreater}/= 10 years before baseline was not. The association between smoking and endometrial carcinoma risk was not significantly modified by any endometrial carcinoma risk factor, nor did we observe major differences in risk associations by tumor characteristics.

METHODS: A population-based cohort study including 1,114,071 women with singleton pregnancies who gave birth in Sweden from January 1, 1997 through December 31, 2008, who were divided into six body mass index (BMI) classes. Obese women (class I-III) were compared with normal-weight women concerning the risk for postpartum hemorrhage after suitable adjustments. The use of heparin-like drugs over the BMI strata was analyzed in a subgroup. RESULTS: There was an increased prevalence of postpartum hemorrhage over the study period associated primarily with changes in maternal characteristics. The risk of atonic uterine hemorrhage increased rapidly with increasing BMI. There was a twofold increased risk in obesity class III (1.8\%). No association was found between postpartum hemorrhage with retained placenta and maternal obesity. There was an increased risk for postpartum hemorrhage for women with a BMI of 40 or higher (5.2\%) after normal delivery (odds ratio [OR] 1.23, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.45]) compared with normal-weight women (4.4\%) and even more pronounced (13.6\%) after instrumental delivery (OR 1.69, 95\% CI 1.22-2.34) compared with normal-weight women (8.8\%). Maternal obesity was a risk factor for the use of heparin-like drugs (OR 2.86, 95\% CI 2.22-3.68). CONCLUSION: The increased risk for atonic postpartum hemorrhage in the obese group has important clinical implications, such as considering administration of prophylactic postpartum uterotonic drugs to this group.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Because the diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) depends on the accoucheur's subjective estimate of blood loss and varies according to mode of delivery, we examined temporal trends in severe PPH, defined as PPH plus receipt of a blood transfusion, hysterectomy, and/or surgical repair of the uterus. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed 8.5 million hospital deliveries in the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1999 to 2008 for temporal trends in, and risk factors for, severe PPH, based on International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, clinical modification diagnosis and procedure codes. Sequential logistic regression models that account for the stratified random sampling design were used to assess the extent to which changes in risk factors explain the trend in severe PPH. RESULTS: Of the total 8,571,209 deliveries, 25,906 (3.0 per 1000) were complicated by severe PPH. The rate rose from 1.9 to 4.2 per 1000 from 1999 to 2008 (P for yearly trend {\textless} .0001), with increases in severe atonic and nonatonic PPH, due especially to PPH with transfusion, but also PPH with hysterectomy. Significant risk factors included maternal age {\textgreater}/=35 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.5; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-1.6), multiple pregnancy (aOR, 2.8; 95\% CI, 2.6-3.0), fibroids (aOR, 2.0; 95\% CI, 1.8-2.2), preeclampsia (aOR, 3.1; 95\% CI, 2.9-3.3), amnionitis (aOR, 2.9; 95\% CI, 2.5-3.4), placenta previa or abruption (aOR, 7.0; 95\% CI, 6.6-7.3), cervical laceration (aOR, 94.0; 95\% CI, 87.3-101.2), uterine rupture (aOR, 11.6; 95\% CI, 9.7-13.8), instrumental vaginal delivery (aOR, 1.5; 95\% CI, 1.4-1.6), and cesarean delivery (aOR, 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.3-1.5). Changes in risk factors, however, accounted for only 5.6\% of the increase in severe PPH. CONCLUSION: A doubling in incidence of severe PPH over 10 years was not explained by contemporaneous changes in studied risk factors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In this study, we sought to (1) define trends in the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), and (2) elucidate the contemporary epidemiology of PPH focusing on risk factors and maternal outcomes related to this delivery complication. METHODS: Hospital admissions for delivery were extracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, the largest discharge dataset in the United States. Using International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification (ninth revision) codes, deliveries complicated by PPH were identified, as were comorbid conditions that may be risk factors for PPH. Temporal trends in the incidence of PPH from 1995 to 2004 were assessed. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for the most common etiology of PPH-uterine atony. RESULTS: In 2004, PPH complicated 2.9\% of all deliveries; uterine atony accounted for 79\% of the cases of PPH. PPH was associated with 19.1\% of all in-hospital deaths after delivery. The overall rate of PPH increased 27.5\% from 1995 to 2004, primarily because of an increase in the incidence of uterine atony; the rates of PPH from other causes including retained placenta and coagulopathy remained relatively stable during the study period. Logistic regression modeling identified age {\textless}20 or {\textgreater} or =40 years, cesarean delivery, hypertensive diseases of pregnancy, polyhydramnios, chorioamnionitis, multiple gestation, retained placenta, and antepartum hemorrhage as independent risk factors for PPH from uterine atony that resulted in transfusion. Excluding maternal age and cesarean delivery, one or more of these risk factors were present in only 38.8\% of these patients. CONCLUSION: PPH is a relatively common complication of delivery and is associated with substantial maternal morbidity and mortality. It is increasing in frequency in the United States. PPH caused by uterine atony resulting in transfusion often occurs in the absence of recognized risk factors.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although a history of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a recognized risk factor for PPH in subsequent pregnancies, little is known about how the risk accumulates over multiple pregnancies, how recurrence varies by PPH subtype, and whether recurrence can be explained by chronic maternal conditions. STUDY DESIGN: Risks of PPH were assessed according to a history of PPH, severity, and subtype (atony, retained placenta, or lacerations) in 538,332 primiparous women whose data were included in the Swedish Medical Birth Register from 1997-2009. The role of stable maternal risk factors was evaluated in regression models that predicted probability of recurrent PPH in second and third pregnancy. RESULTS: Women with a history of PPH had a 3-fold increased risk of PPH in their second pregnancy compared with unaffected women (15.0\% vs 5.0\%, respectively). Adjustment for stable maternal risk factors did not attenuate this risk significantly (adjusted relative risk, 3.0; 95\% confidence interval, 2.9-3.1). In a third pregnancy, the risk of PPH was 26.6\% after 2 previously affected pregnancies, compared with 4.4\% in women with no previous PPH. A history of a specific type of PPH predicted recurrence of PPH in the second pregnancy, not only of the same type but other causes as well. CONCLUSION: PPH risk is highest among women with {\textgreater}1 previously affected delivery and in those with a previous severe PPH. Chronic conditions that are known to be risk factors for PPH do not explain the recurrence risks. The recurrence patterns across PPH subtypes may point to shared pathologic mechanisms underlying the varying PPH causes.},

METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the records of women with hematologic malignancies treated at our institution from January 2002 through January 2016. Women with AUB as the chief presenting symptom were identified. RESULTS: Of the 10,682 women with hematologic malignancies, 38 had AUB as their chief presenting symptom. These women were young (median age 34 years), premenopausal, and otherwise healthy. The top four additional presenting symptoms were fatigue, dyspnea or shortness of breath, bruising or petechiae, and fever, with means (95\% confidence interval) of 58\% (41-74\%), 42\% (26-59\%), 42\% (26-59\%), and 24\% (11-40\%), respectively. The complete blood count on initial presentation with AUB revealed that 33 (87\%) women had anemia (mean hemoglobin level 8.6 g/dL) and 34 (89\%) had thrombocytopenia (mean platelet count 81,000/microliter). Twelve (32\%) women had neutropenia, eight (21\%) women had normal white blood cell counts, and 18 (47\%) women had leukocytosis. Thirty-three women (87\%) were diagnosed with acute leukemia, one with myelodysplastic syndrome (3\%) and four (11\%) with chronic leukemia. CONCLUSION: We estimate the incidence of AUB as the chief presenting symptom is 3.6 cases per 1,000 women with hematologic cancer. These young, otherwise healthy women who present with acute, new-onset heavy menstrual bleeding in conjunction with thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia should be referred to hematology for evaluation of possible hematologic malignancy.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is characterized by increased risk for cancer, especially colorectal cancer. It has been recommended that colon cancer control programs for family members be expanded to include endometrial cancer, the commonest extracolonic cancer observed in HNPCC families. We estimated the age-specific and cumulative endometrial cancer risk for women at high risk for HNPCC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Family history data from three large HNPCC registries were combined for this study. High risk family members were identified without regard to extracolonic cancer. Life table methods were used to calculate estimates of risk.
RESULTS: One thousand eighteen women from 86 families were included in the study. Cumulative incidence was 20\% by age 70, compared to 3\% in the general population. Risk was highest in women most likely to carry the HNPCC gene (P {\textless}0.001). In this group, during the highest risk years (age 40 to 60), average annual risk exceeded 1\%. There was no significant difference among the registries, despite different ascertainment practices regarding endometrial cancer.
CONCLUSION: Interventions to reduce endometrial cancer morbidity and mortality are justified by the risk levels observed. Prophylactic total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy should be recommended to women in HNPCC families who have a syndrome cancer or offspring with a syndrome cancer. Endometrial cancer screening should be available to women at high risk. Studies of screening protocols are needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Different abdominal symptoms may signal cancer, but their role is unclear. AIM: To examine associations between abdominal symptoms and subsequent cancer diagnosed in the abdominal region. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective cohort study comprising 493 GPs from surgeries in Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Scotland, Belgium, and the Netherlands. METHOD: Over a 10-day period, the GPs recorded consecutive consultations and noted: patients who presented with abdominal symptoms pre-specified on the registration form; additional data on non-specific symptoms; and features of the consultation. Eight months later, data on all cancer diagnoses among all study patients in the participating general practices were requested from the GPs. RESULTS: Consultations with 61 802 patients were recorded and abdominal symptoms were documented in 6264 (10.1\%) patients. Malignancy, both abdominal and non-abdominal, was subsequently diagnosed in 511 patients (0.8\%). Among patients with a new cancer in the abdomen (n = 251), 175 (69.7\%) were diagnosed within 180 days after consultation. In a multivariate model, the highest sex- and age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was for the single symptom of rectal bleeding (HR 19.1, 95\% confidence interval = 8.7 to 41.7). Positive predictive values of {\textgreater}3\% were found for macroscopic haematuria, rectal bleeding, and involuntary weight loss, with variations according to age and sex. The three symptoms relating to irregular bleeding had particularly high specificity in terms of colorectal, uterine, and bladder cancer. CONCLUSIONS: A patient with undiagnosed cancer may present with symptoms or no symptoms. Irregular bleeding must always be explained. Abdominal pain occurs with all types of abdominal cancer and several symptoms may signal colorectal cancer. The findings are important as they influence how GPs think and act, and how they can contribute to an earlier diagnosis of cancer.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a well-known symptom of colorectal cancer (CRC). Whether incident GI bleeding is also a marker of other GI cancers remains unclear. METHODS: This nationwide cohort study examined the risk of various GI cancer types in patients with lower GI bleeding. We used Danish medical registries to identify all patients with a first-time hospital diagnosis of lower GI bleeding during 1995-2011 and followed them for 10 years to identify subsequent GI cancer diagnoses. We computed absolute risks of cancer, treating death as a competing risk, and calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) by comparing observed cancer cases with expected cancer incidence rates in the general population. RESULTS: Among 58,593 patients with lower GI bleeding, we observed 2,806 GI cancers during complete 10-year follow-up. During the first year of follow-up, the absolute GI cancer risk was 3.6\%, and the SIR of any GI cancer was 16.3 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 15.6-17.0). Colorectal cancers accounted for the majority of diagnoses, but risks of all GI cancers were increased. During 1-5 years of follow-up, the SIR of any GI cancer declined to 1.36 (95\% CI: 1.25-1.49), but risks remained increased for several GI cancers. Beyond 5 years of follow-up, the overall GI cancer risk was close to unity, with reduced risk of rectal cancer and increased risk of liver and pancreatic cancers. CONCLUSIONS: A hospital-based diagnosis of lower GI bleeding is a strong clinical marker of prevalent GI cancer, particularly CRC. It also predicts an increased risk of any GI cancer beyond 1 year of follow-up.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Women who were younger at their first live birth have a reduced breast cancer risk. Other pregnancy characteristics, including complications, also may affect risk but because they are rare, require large datasets to study. METHODS: The association of pregnancy history and breast cancer risk was assessed in a population-based study including 22,646 cases diagnosed in Washington State 1974 to 2009, and 224,721 controls, frequency matched on parity, age, calendar year of delivery, and race/ethnicity. Information on prediagnosis pregnancies derived from linked birth certificate and hospital discharge databases. Adjusted odd ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: Multiple gestation pregnancies were associated with decreased breast cancer risk (OR, 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.57-0.74) as was prepregnancy obesity (OR, 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.65-0.90). Infant birth weight was positively associated (6\% per 1,000 g; 95\% CI, 3\%-9\%). The ORs for first trimester bleeding (OR, 3.35; 95\% CI, 1.48-7.55) and placental abnormality/insufficiency (OR, 2.24; 95\% CI, 1.08-4.67) were increased in women diagnosed at age 50+ years and 15+ years after the index pregnancy. Results were similar in analyses restricted to first pregnancies, those closest to diagnosis, and when excluding in situ disease. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that multiple gestation pregnancies are protective, whereas delivering larger infants increases risk for later development of maternal breast cancer. Placental abnormalities that result in bleeding in pregnancy also may reverse the long-term protection in postmenopausal women associated with parity. IMPACT: Certain pregnancy characteristics seem to be associated with later maternal breast cancer risk.},

SETTING: Primary care setting in the UK. The analysis was from the National Health Service perspective. PARTICIPANTS: 1000 individuals with SMI from The Health Improvement Network Database, aged 30-74 years and without existing CVD, populated the model. INTERVENTIONS: Four cardiovascular risk algorithms were assessed: (1) general population lipid, (2) general population body mass index (BMI), (3) SMI-specific lipid and (4) SMI-specific BMI, compared against no algorithm. At baseline, each cardiovascular risk algorithm was applied and those considered high risk ({\textgreater} 10\%) were assumed to be prescribed statin therapy while others received usual care. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs were accrued for each algorithm including no algorithm, and cost-effectiveness was calculated using the net monetary benefit (NMB) approach. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test assumptions made and uncertainty around parameter estimates. RESULTS: The SMI-specific BMI algorithm had the highest NMB resulting in 15 additional QALYs and a cost saving of approximately pound53 000 per 1000 patients with SMI over 10 years, followed by the general population lipid algorithm (13 additional QALYs and a cost saving of pound46 000). CONCLUSIONS: The general population lipid and SMI-specific BMI algorithms performed equally well. The ease and acceptability of use of an SMI-specific BMI algorithm (blood tests not required) makes it an attractive algorithm to implement in clinical settings.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Glucocorticoids are widely used medications. In many pharmacoepidemiological studies, duration of individual prescriptions and definition of treatment episodes are important issues. However, many data sources lack this information. We aimed to estimate duration of individual prescriptions for oral glucocorticoids and to describe continuous treatment episodes using the parametric waiting time distribution. Methods: We used Danish nationwide registries to identify all prescriptions for oral glucocorticoids during 1996-2014. We applied the parametric waiting time distribution to estimate duration of individual prescriptions each year by estimating the 80th, 90th, 95th and 99th percentiles for the interarrival distribution. These corresponded to the time since last prescription during which 80\%, 90\%, 95\% and 99\% of users presented a new prescription for redemption. We used the Kaplan-Meier survival function to estimate length of first continuous treatment episodes by assigning estimated prescription duration to each prescription and thereby create treatment episodes from overlapping prescriptions. Results: We identified 5,691,985 prescriptions issued to 854,429 individuals of whom 351,202 (41\%) only redeemed 1 prescription in the whole study period. The 80th percentile for prescription duration ranged from 87 to 120 days, the 90th percentile from 116 to 150 days, the 95th percentile from 147 to 181 days, and the 99th percentile from 228 to 259 days during 1996-2014. Based on the 80th, 90th, 95th and 99th percentiles of prescription duration, the median length of continuous treatment was 113, 141, 170 and 243 days, respectively. Conclusion: Our method and results may provide an important framework for future pharmacoepidemiological studies. The choice of which percentile of the interarrival distribution to apply as prescription duration has an impact on the level of misclassification. Use of the 80th percentile provides a measure of drug exposure that is specific, while the 99th percentile provides a sensitive measure.},

	abstract = {The benefits of using electronic health records for disease risk screening and personalized heathcare decisions are becoming increasingly recognized. We present a computationally feasible statistical approach to address the methodological challenges in utilizing historical repeat measures of multiple risk factors recorded in electronic health records to systematically identify patients at high risk of future disease. The approach is principally based on a two-stage dynamic landmark model. The first stage estimates current risk factor values from all available historical repeat risk factor measurements by landmark-age-specific multivariate linear mixed-effects models with correlated random-intercepts, which account for sporadically recorded repeat measures, unobserved data and measurements errors. The second stage predicts future disease risk from a sex-stratified Cox proportional hazards model, with estimated current risk factor values from the first stage. Methods are exemplified by developing and validating a dynamic 10-year cardiovascular disease risk prediction model using electronic primary care records for age, diabetes status, hypertension treatment, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol from 41,373 individuals in 10 primary care practices in England and Wales contributing to The Health Improvement Network (1997-2016). Using cross-validation, the model was well-calibrated (Brier score = 0.041 [95\%CI: 0.039, 0.042]) and had good discrimination (C-index = 0.768 [95\%CI: 0.759, 0.777]).},

Women who were attempting to become pregnant completed a validated food frequency questionnaire at baseline. Pregnancy status was updated bimonthly for 12 months or until pregnancy. Fecundability ratios (FR) and 95\% confidence intervals were estimated using multivariable proportional probabilities regression. Intakes of total fat and saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and omega-6 fatty acids were not appreciably associated with fecundability. TFA intake was associated with reduced fecundability in North American women (for the fourth quartile vs. the first, FR = 0.86, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.71, 1.04) but not Danish women (for the fourth quartile vs. the first, FR = 1.04, 95\% CI: 0.86, 1.25), though intake among Danish women was low.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of mother-PHEU infant pairs in the Surveillance Monitoring for ART Toxicities protocol of the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study. METHODS: Pregnant women living with HIV who initiated an antiretroviral regimen during pregnancy were followed from the date of antiretroviral initiation. Women were classified according to whether the antiretroviral regimen contained atazanavir and the trimester of antiretroviral initiation. Neurodevelopment at 9-15 months was evaluated using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-Third Edition (Bayley-III). We estimated mean differences for the five Bayley-III domains for atazanavir-containing regimens versus all other regimens. Models included baseline covariates and adjustment for failure to complete the Bayley-III using inverse probability weighting. RESULTS: PHEU infants were exposed in utero to atazanavir-containing (n = 167) and nonatazanavir-containing (n = 750) antiretroviral regimens. The adjusted mean differences (95\% confidence interval) in Bayley-III domain scores for initiating an atazanavir-containing regimen in the first trimester were: cognitive, -1.5 (-6.2, 3.2); language, -3.3 (-7.6, 1.0); motor, -2.9 (-7.7, 1.9); social-emotional, 0.1 (-6.2, 6.4); and adaptive behavior, -0.1 (-4.3, 4.0). The mean differences for the second or third trimester were: cognitive, 0.4 (-3.2, 4.0); language, -3.4 (-6.2, -0.5); motor, 0.3 (-2.9, 3.4); social-emotional, -5.9 (-9.4, -2.3); and adaptive behavior, -2.5 (-5.9, 0.8). CONCLUSION: In-utero exposure to atazanavir-containing regimens compared with non-atazanavir-containing regimens may adversely affect language and social-emotional development in PHEU infants during the first year of life, but the absolute difference is small.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence for the effect of weight loss on coronary heart disease (CHD) or mortality has been mixed. The effect estimates can be confounded due to undiagnosed diseases that may affect weight loss. METHODS: We used data from the Nurses' Health Study to estimate the 26-year risk of CHD under several hypothetical weight loss strategies. We applied the parametric g-formula and implemented a novel sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding due to undiagnosed disease by imposing a lag time for the effect of weight loss on chronic disease. Several sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The estimated 26-year risk of CHD did not change under weight loss strategies using lag times from 0 to 18 years. For a 6-year lag time, the risk ratios of CHD for weight loss compared with no weight loss ranged from 1.00 (0.99, 1.02) to 1.02 (0.99, 1.05) for different degrees of weight loss with and without restricting the weight loss strategy to participants with no major chronic disease. Similarly, no protective effect of weight loss was estimated for mortality risk. In contrast, we estimated a protective effect of weight loss on risk of type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSION: We estimated that maintaining or losing weight after becoming overweight or obese does not reduce the risk of CHD or death in this cohort of middle-age US women. Unmeasured confounding, measurement error, and model misspecification are possible explanations but these did not prevent us from estimating a beneficial effect of weight loss on diabetes.},

In their thoughtful paper, the authors outline several reasons that a causal effect estimated using an ABM may be biased when parameterized from at least 1 source external to the target population. The authors have addressed an important issue in epidemiology: Often causal effect estimates are needed to inform public health decisions in settings without complete data. Because public health decisions are urgent, epidemiologists are frequently called upon to estimate a causal effect from existing data in a separate population rather than perform new data collection activities. The assumptions needed to transport causal effects to a specific target population must be carefully stated and assessed, just as one would explicitly state and analyze the assumptions required to draw internally valid causal inference in a specific study sample. Considering external validity in important target populations increases the impact of epidemiologic studies.},

In particular, their work focused on the biases that can arise in ABMs that use parameters drawn from distinct populations whose causal structures and baseline outcome risks differ. This demonstration of the quantitative issues that arise in transporting effects between populations has implications not only for ABMs but for all epidemiologic applications, because making use of epidemiologic results requires application beyond a study sample. Broadly, because health arises within complex, dynamic, and hierarchical systems, many research questions cannot be answered statistically without strong assumptions. It will require every tool in our store of methods to properly understand population dynamics if we wish to build an evidence base that is adequate for action.

	abstract = {Importance: Patients with cancer who use statins appear to have a substantially better survival than nonusers in observational studies. However, this inverse association between statin use and mortality may be due to selection bias and immortal-time bias. Objective: To emulate a randomized trial of statin therapy initiation that is free of selection bias and immortal-time bias. Design, Setting, and Participants: We used observational data on 17372 patients with cancer from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database (2007-2009) with complete follow-up until 2011. The SEER-Medicare database links 17 US cancer registries and claims files from Medicare and Medicaid in 12 US states. We included individuals with a new diagnosis of colorectal, breast, prostate, or bladder cancer who had not been prescribed statins for at least 6 months before the cancer diagnosis. Individuals were duplicated, and each replicate was assigned to either the strategy "statin therapy initiation within 6 months after diagnosis" or "no statin therapy initiation." Replicates were censored when they stopped following their assigned strategy, and the potential selection bias was adjusted for via inverse-probability weighting. Hazard ratios (HRs), cumulative incidences, and risk differences were calculated for all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality. We then compared our estimates with those obtained using the same analytic approaches used in previous observational studies. Exposures: Statin therapy initiation within 6 months after cancer diagnosis. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cancer-specific and all-cause mortality using SEER-Medicare data and data from previous studies. Results: Of the 17372 patients whose data were analyzed, 8440 (49\%) were men, and 8932 (51\%) were women (mean [SD] age, 76.4 [7.4] years; range, 66-115 years). The adjusted HR (95\% CI) comparing statin therapy initiation vs no initiation was 1.00 (0.88-1.15) for cancer-specific mortality and 1.07 (0.93-1.21) for overall mortality. Cumulative incidence curves for both groups were almost overlapping (the risk difference never exceeded 0.8\%). In contrast, the methods used by prior studies resulted in an inverse association between statin use and mortality (pooled hazard ratio 0.69). Conclusion and Relevance: After using methods that are not susceptible to selection bias from prevalent users and to immortal time bias, we found that initiation of therapy with statins within 6 months after cancer diagnosis did not appear to improve 3-year cancer-specific or overall survival.},

Sugar-sweetened beverages were associated with poor semen quality in cross-sectional studies, and female soda intake has been associated with lower fecundability in some studies. METHODS: We evaluated the association of female and male sugar-sweetened beverage intake with fecundability among 3,828 women planning pregnancy and 1,045 of their male partners in a North American prospective cohort study. We followed participants until pregnancy or for up to 12 menstrual cycles. Eligible women were aged 21-45 (male partners {\textgreater}/=21), attempting conception for {\textless}/=6 cycles, and not using fertility treatments. Participants completed a comprehensive baseline questionnaire, including questions on sugar-sweetened beverage consumption during the previous 4 weeks. We estimated time-to-pregnancy from follow-up questionnaires completed every 2 months by the female partner. We calculated adjusted fecundability ratios (FR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) according to intake of sugar- sweetened beverages using proportional probabilities regression. RESULTS: Both female and male intakes of sugar-sweetened beverages were associated with reduced fecundability (FR = 0.81; 95\% CI = 0.70, 0.94 and 0.78; 95\% CI = 0.63, 0.95 for {\textgreater}/=7 sugar-sweetened beverages per week compared with none, for females and males, respectively).

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) studies are often described as naturally occurring randomized trials in which genetic factors are randomly assigned by nature. Conceptualizing MR studies as randomized trials has profound implications for their design, conduct, reporting, and interpretation. For example, analytic practices that are discouraged in randomized trials should also be discouraged in MR studies. Here, we deconstruct the oft-made analogy between MR and randomized trials. We describe four key threats to the analogy between MR studies and randomized trials: (1) exchangeability is not guaranteed; (2) time zero (and therefore the time for setting eligibility criteria) is unclear; (3) the treatment assignment is often measured with error; and (4) adherence is poorly defined. By precisely defining the causal effects being estimated, we underscore that MR estimates are often vaguely analogous to per-protocol effects in randomized trials, and that current MR methods for estimating analogues of per-protocol effects could be biased in practice. We conclude that the analogy between randomized trials and MR studies provides further perspective on both the strengths and the limitations of MR studies as currently implemented, as well as future directions for MR methodology development and application. In particular, the analogy highlights potential future directions for some MR studies to produce more interpretable and informative numerical estimates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individual-level simulation models are valuable tools for comparing the impact of clinical or public health interventions on population health and cost outcomes over time. However, a key challenge is ensuring that outcome estimates correctly reflect real-world impacts. Calibration to targets obtained from randomized trials may be insufficient if trials do not exist for populations, time periods, or interventions of interest. Observational data can provide a wider range of calibration targets but requires methods to adjust for treatment-confounder feedback. We propose the use of the parametric g-formula to estimate calibration targets and present a case-study to demonstrate its application. METHODS: We used the parametric g-formula applied to data from the HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration to estimate calibration targets for 7-y risks of AIDS and/or death (AIDS/death), as defined by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention under 3 treatment initiation strategies. We compared these targets to projections from the Cost-effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications (CEPAC) model for treatment-naive individuals presenting to care in the following year ranges: 1996 to 1999, 2000 to 2002, or 2003 onwards. RESULTS: The parametric g-formula estimated a decreased risk of AIDS/death over time and with earlier treatment. The uncalibrated CEPAC model successfully reproduced targets obtained via the g-formula for baseline 1996 to 1999, but over-estimated calibration targets in contemporary populations and failed to reproduce time trends in AIDS/death risk. Calibration to g-formula targets improved CEPAC model fit for contemporary populations. CONCLUSION: Individual-level simulation models are developed based on best available information about disease processes in one or more populations of interest, but these processes can change over time or between populations. The parametric g-formula provides a method for using observational data to obtain valid calibration targets and enables updating of simulation model inputs when randomized trials are not available.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To quantify risk factors for venous thromboembolism during pregnancy and the puerperal period. DESIGN: In a nationwide prospective cohort study we followed pregnant and puerperal women in Denmark from 1995 to 2009 for venous thromboembolism. Information on risk factors and confounders was retrieved from national registries. The diagnosis of venous thromboembolism was confirmed through medical charts. We calculated adjusted incidence rates per 10,000 women years and used Poisson regression to estimate effects during pregnancy and the puerperal period. RESULTS: We studied 1,297,037 pregnancies and related puerperal periods, during which there were 748 venous thromboembolisms. The incidence rate for venous thromboembolism during a pregnancy with and without hospitalization for hyperemesis was 15.2/10,000 yr and 6.3/10,000 yr, respectively, (adjusted rate ratio: 2.5 (95\%-confidence interval; 1.4-4.5)). The incidence rate among women with multiple pregnancies was 18.2/10,000 yr and 6.3/10,000 yr in singletons (adjusted rate ratio: 2.8 (1.9-4.2)). Increased risk was found with hospitalization during pregnancy or the puerperal period with incidence rates of 42.1/10.000 and 54.7/10.000, respectively, (rate ratios: 12.2 (8.7-17) and 5.9 (4.0-8.8)). Women hospitalized with infections during pregnancy had incidence rates of 25.9/10,000 yr and 29.3/10,000 yr during pregnancy and the puerperal period, respectively, and of 62.7/10,000 yr if hospitalized with infection in the puerperal period. Puerperal venous thromboembolism was associated with hospitalization for preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction/fetal death with incidence rates of 45.8/10,000 yr and 18.3/10,000 yr, respectively (rate ratio: 5.0 (3.1-7.8) and 1.9 (0.9-4.4)). Additionally puerperal venous thromboembolism was associated with obesity, elective and acute caesarean sections and major postpartum bleeding with incidence rates of 25.5/10,000 yr, 23.2/10,000 yr, 34.0/10,000 yr and 20.3/10,000 yr, respectively (rate ratios 1.7 (1.1-2.7), 2.1 (1.4-3.1), 3.0 (2.3-4.0) and 1.4 (1.0-2.1)). CONCLUSIONS: Important risk factors for venous thromboembolism during pregnancy or the puerperal period were hospitalization, infection, hyperemesis, multiple pregnancies, preeclampsia, obesity, caesarean section, major postpartum bleeding, and intrauterine growth restriction or fetal death.},

In an initial validation, PheRS distinguished cases and controls of five Mendelian diseases. Applying PheRS to 21,701 genotyped individuals uncovered 18 associations between rare variants and phenotypes consistent with Mendelian diseases. In 16 patients, the rare genetic variants were associated with severe outcomes such as organ transplants.

We previously demonstrated that adherence adjustment can be validly conducted in the Coronary Drug Project using a simplistic approach. Here, we re-analyze the data using an approach that takes full advantage of recent methodological developments. METHODS: We used inverse-probability weighted hazards models to estimate the 5-year survival and mortality risk when individuals in the placebo arm of the Coronary Drug Project adhere to at least 80\% of the drug continuously or never during the 5-year follow-up period. RESULTS: Adjustment for post-randomization covariates resulted in 5-year mortality risk difference estimates ranging from - 0.7 (95\% confidence intervals (CI), - 12.2, 10.7) to 4.5 (95\% CI, - 6.3, 15.3) percentage points. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis confirms that appropriate adjustment for post-randomization predictors of adherence largely removes the association between adherence to placebo and mortality originally described in this trial.

To stimulate discussion of outmoded thinking regarding the conduct of research, I list six misconceptions about research that persist long after their flaws have become apparent. The misconceptions are: 1) There is a hierarchy of study designs; randomized trials provide the greatest validity, followed by cohort studies, with case-control studies being least reliable. 2) An essential element for valid generalization is that the study subjects constitute a representative sample of a target population. 3) If a term that denotes the product of two factors in a regression model is not statistically significant, then there is no biologic interaction between those factors. 4) When categorizing a continuous variable, a reasonable scheme for choosing category cut-points is to use percentile-defined boundaries, such as quartiles or quintiles of the distribution. 5) One should always report P values or confidence intervals that have been adjusted for multiple comparisons. 6) Significance testing is useful and important for the interpretation of data. These misconceptions have been perpetuated in journals, classrooms and textbooks. They persist because they represent intellectual shortcuts that avoid more thoughtful approaches to research problems. I hope that calling attention to these misconceptions will spark the debates needed to shelve these outmoded ideas for good.},

	abstract = {Inflammatory markers are highly amenable to appraise and adjust and could already serve as a diagnostic indicator and also as a predictor of prognosis over the management of many health problems. Inflammation is implicated in venous thromboembolism (VTE). However there is still an intense curiosity about whether it is a cause or only a consequence of the thromboembolic process. The more likely scenario is that some inflammatory mediators contribute to the development of VTE, which per se induces an inflammatory reaction. Here we will review evidences supporting the role of inflammation as a cause of VTE. Genetic association studies have provided possible links between inflammation-related genetic variants, especially cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13), and VTE, leading to establish the fundamental role of genetic background in predisposition to VTE and variable inflammatory processes in individuals. Additionally, several inflammation-related conditions including aging, autoimmune disease, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, hormone replacement therapy, infectious diseases, metabolic diseases, overweight or obesity, pregnancy or postpartum, respiratory diseases, and trauma have been associated with an increased risk of VTE. At this moment, despite their theoretical potential, to achieve the implementation of the inflammation-related laboratory tests in practice is a long task and future studies with larger sample sizes are required to address whether the properties of the inflammatory process, particularly intensity and duration, are useful in determining the risk of VTE and following outcomes.},

DESIGN: National cohort study. SETTING: Denmark, 1995-2005. PARTICIPANTS: Danish women aged 15-49 with no history of cardiovascular or malignant disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adjusted rate ratios for all first time deep venous thrombosis, portal thrombosis, thrombosis of caval vein, thrombosis of renal vein, unspecified deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism during the study period. RESULTS: 10.4 million woman years were recorded, 3.3 million woman years in receipt of oral contraceptives. In total, 4213 venous thrombotic events were observed, 2045 in current users of oral contraceptives. The overall absolute risk of venous thrombosis per 10 000 woman years in non-users of oral contraceptives was 3.01 and in current users was 6.29. Compared with non-users of combined oral contraceptives the rate ratio of venous thrombembolism in current users decreased with duration of use ({\textless}1 year 4.17, 95\% confidence interval 3.73 to 4.66, 1-4 years 2.98, 2.73 to 3.26, and {\textgreater}4 years 2.76, 2.53 to 3.02; P{\textless}0.001) and with decreasing dose of oestrogen. Compared with oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel and with the same dose of oestrogen and length of use, the rate ratio for oral contraceptives with norethisterone was 0.98 (0.71 to 1.37), with norgestimate 1.19 (0.96 to 1.47), with desogestrel 1.82 (1.49 to 2.22), with gestodene 1.86 (1.59 to 2.18), with drospirenone 1.64 (1.27 to 2.10), and with cyproterone 1.88 (1.47 to 2.42). Compared with non-users of oral contraceptives, the rate ratio for venous thromboembolism in users of progestogen only oral contraceptives with levonorgestrel or norethisterone was 0.59 (0.33 to 1.03) or with 75 mug desogestrel was 1.12 (0.36 to 3.49), and for hormone releasing intrauterine devices was 0.90 (0.64 to 1.26). CONCLUSION: The risk of venous thrombosis in current users of combined oral contraceptives decreases with duration of use and decreasing oestrogen dose. For the same dose of oestrogen and the same length of use, oral contraceptives with desogestrel, gestodene, or drospirenone were associated with a significantly higher risk of venous thrombosis than oral contraceptives with levonorgestrel. Progestogen only pills and hormone releasing intrauterine devices were not associated with any increased risk of venous thrombosis.},

DESIGN: Population based case-control study. SETTING: Six participating anticoagulation clinics in the Netherlands (Amersfoort, Amsterdam, The Hague, Leiden, Rotterdam, and Utrecht). PARTICIPANTS: Premenopausal women {\textless}50 years old who were not pregnant, not within four weeks postpartum, and not using a hormone excreting intrauterine device or depot contraceptive. Analysis included 1524 patients and 1760 controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: First objectively diagnosed episodes of deep venous thrombosis of the leg or pulmonary embolism. Odds ratios calculated by cross-tabulation with a 95\% confidence interval according to Woolf's method; adjusted odds ratios estimated by unconditional logistic regression, standard errors derived from the model. RESULTS: Currently available oral contraceptives increased the risk of venous thrombosis fivefold compared with non-use (odds ratio 5.0, 95\% CI 4.2 to 5.8). The risk clearly differed by type of progestogen and dose of oestrogen. The use of oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel was associated with an almost fourfold increased risk of venous thrombosis (odds ratio 3.6, 2.9 to 4.6) relative to non-users, whereas the risk of venous thrombosis compared with non-use was increased 5.6-fold for gestodene (5.6, 3.7 to 8.4), 7.3-fold for desogestrel (7.3, 5.3 to 10.0), 6.8-fold for cyproterone acetate (6.8, 4.7 to 10.0), and 6.3-fold for drospirenone (6.3, 2.9 to 13.7). The risk of venous thrombosis was positively associated with oestrogen dose. We confirmed a high risk of venous thrombosis during the first months of oral contraceptive use irrespective of the type of oral contraceptives. CONCLUSIONS: Currently available oral contraceptives still have a major impact on thrombosis occurrence and many women do not use the safest brands with regard to risk of venous thrombosis.},

DESIGN: National historical registry based cohort study. SETTING: Four registries in Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: Non-pregnant Danish women aged 15-49 with no history of thrombotic disease and followed from January 2001 to December 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative and absolute risks of first time venous thromboembolism. RESULTS: Within 8,010,290 women years of observation, 4307 first ever venous thromboembolic events were recorded and 4246 included, among which 2847 (67\%) events were confirmed as certain. Compared with non-users of hormonal contraception, the relative risk of confirmed venous thromboembolism in users of oral contraceptives containing 30-40 microg ethinylestradiol with levonorgestrel was 2.9 (95\% confidence interval 2.2 to 3.8), with desogestrel was 6.6 (5.6 to 7.8), with gestodene was 6.2 (5.6 to 7.0), and with drospirenone was 6.4 (5.4 to 7.5). With users of oral contraceptives with levonorgestrel as reference and after adjusting for length of use, the rate ratio of confirmed venous thromboembolism for users of oral contraceptives with desogestrel was 2.2 (1.7 to 3.0), with gestodene was 2.1 (1.6 to 2.8), and with drospirenone was 2.1 (1.6 to 2.8). The risk of confirmed venous thromboembolism was not increased with use of progestogen only pills or hormone releasing intrauterine devices. If oral contraceptives with desogestrel, gestodene, or drospirenone are anticipated to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism sixfold and those with levonorgestrel threefold, and the absolute risk of venous thromboembolism in current users of the former group is on average 10 per 10,000 women years, then 2000 women would need to shift from using oral contraceptives with desogestrel, gestodene, or drospirenone to those with levonorgestrel to prevent one event of venous thromboembolism in one year. CONCLUSION: After adjustment for length of use, users of oral contraceptives with desogestrel, gestodene, or drospirenone were at least at twice the risk of venous thromboembolism compared with users of oral contraceptives with levonorgestrel.},

	abstract = {Normal pregnancy is associated with extensive changes in hemostasis such that the procoagulant effect becomes dominant. The evolutionary advantage of this hypercoagulability may be to counteract the inherent instability associated with hemochorial placentation, which is unique to human beings. However, overall, there is a four- to 10-fold increased thrombotic risk throughout gestation and the postpartum period. Certain inherited or acquired thrombophilic factors may predispose to arterial and/or venous thrombosis and have a possible association with pregnancy complications, including recurrent miscarriage (RM), which affects up to 5\% of couples with childbearing desire. A subgroup of women with RM has been demonstrated to be in a prothombotic state before and after pregnancy. The long-term health implications of this hypercoagulability may imply an increased risk of ischemic heart disease. Moreover, the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies rather than thrombophilic genetic defects (i.e., factor V Leiden or prothrombin G202010A mutation) in patients with RM is a determinant of thrombotic events later in life, especially among those patients having also cardiovascular risk factors. This article highlights the thromboembolic risk in nonpregnant RM patients in different thrombophilic settings and the need for thromboprophylaxis among these patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: FXIII Val34Leu (rs5985) and beta-fibrinogen -455G/A (rs1800790) genotypes have been reported to be associated with recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA). However, this topic is controversial. This study aimed to explore whether FXIII Val34Leu or beta-fibrinogen -455G/A gene polymorphisms are related to RSA. METHODS: In this analysis, PubMed, HuGENet and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases were reviewed. Four models including the dominant model (Val/Val+Val/Leu vs. Leu/Leu), recessive model (Val/Val vs Val/Leu + Leu/Leu), co-dominant model (Val/Val vs. Val/Leu, Val/Val vs. Leu/Leu) and per-allele analysis (Val vs. Leu) were applied. The odds ratio (OR) with 95\% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the association between RSA and FXIII Val34Leu and beta-fibrinogen -455G/A polymorphisms. RESULTS: Nine studies with 10 sets of data were included according to the inclusion criterion. A positive association was detected in the pooled results for the dominant model (Val/Val+Val/Leu vs. Leu/Leu; OR = 0.417, 95\% CI: 0.180-0.965, I(2) = 45.60\%) and co-dominant model (Val/Val vs. Val/Leu; OR = 0.638, 95\% CI: 0.452-0.899, I(2) = 36.40\%) for FXIII Val34Leu polymorphisms. However, no statistically significant association between beta-fibrinogen -455G/A polymorphisms and RSA was detected in the four different models, including the Asian and Caucasian subgroup analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis demonstrates that the FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism has a close association with RSA and women who carry the Val allele for the FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism could have a protective effect against RSA. However, no association is detected between beta-fibrinogen -455G/A polymorphisms and the risk of RSA. Future well-designed studies are needed to confirm these results.},

	abstract = {Thrombophilia by definition represents acquired and/or genetic conditions that predispose patients to both venous and arterial thromboembolic events. Thrombosis is the most common cause of death worldwide. On the arterial side, myocardial infarction and stroke result in significant morbidity and mortality. Venous thromboembolic events most commonly involve the deep veins of the lower extremity with potential complications of pulmonary emboli. Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state, and thromboembolism is the leading cause of antepartum and postpartum maternal mortality. With the description by Dahlback in 1993 of a condition initially labeled activated protein C resistance, significant advances have rapidly followed. Activated protein C resistance was linked to an underlying point mutation resulting in coagulation factor V (factor V Leiden). Recent attention has focused on certain inherited thrombophilic factors that may predispose to arterial and/or venous thromboses and their possible association with pregnancy complications, including early pregnancy loss. These include a group of mostly autosomal dominant, inherited gene mutations leading to a hypercoagulable state, such as factor V Leiden G1691A, factor II or prothrombin G20210A, and hyperhomocysteinemia associated with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T mutation. In addition, deficiencies in protein S, protein C, and antithrombin can lead to a hypercoagulable state. Although some studies of recurrent pregnancy loss patients with a positive test for an inherited thrombophilia are conflicting, a case-control study of untreated recurrent miscarriage patients who were heterozygous for the factor V Leiden mutation revealed a lower success rate than the controls who had a history of idiopathic recurrent miscarriage. With the identification of genetic risk factors, there has been synergistic amplification of thrombotic risk when one has an abnormal gene (e.g., factor V Leiden) plus environmental issues (e.g., pregnancy). Current understanding indicates that a combination of risk factors, including multiple inherited thrombophilic defects associated with secondary hypercoagulable states, have a particularly strong association with adverse pregnancy outcome.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A potential role of prenatal and perinatal exposures in autoimmunity has been hypothesized, but few studies have examined the relation between various prenatal and perinatal factors and the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: The study population included participants in the Nurses' Health Studies--2 prospective cohorts that together comprise 238,381 female nurses, who self-reported exposure to prenatal and perinatal factors. In addition, 35,815 nurses' mothers participated by providing detailed information regarding experiences surrounding their daughter's birth. The following prenatal and perinatal factors were studied in relation to MS: fetal growth, birth season, preterm birth, mode of delivery, maternal weight gain, medical conditions, medication use, diethylstilbestrol exposure, prenatal health care, maternal activity level, maternal obstetric history, parental age, and prenatal and childhood passive smoke exposure. RESULTS: The sample included 723 confirmed MS cases, including 383 with diagnosis after reporting prenatal and perinatal factors. Few associations were observed. These included an increased risk among women whose mothers reported late initiation of prenatal care (after the first trimester) (27 cases; rate ratio = 1.6 [95\% confidence interval = 1.0-2.4]), diabetes during pregnancy (2 cases; 10 [2.5-42]), and maternal prepregnancy overweight/obesity (20 cases; 1.7 [1.0-2.7]). Results also suggested a possible increase in incident MS risk among women with prenatal diethylstilbestrol exposure (9 cases; 1.8 [0.93-3.5]). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides modest support for a role of prenatal factors in MS risk. The results should be interpreted cautiously due to the limited statistical power, potential for exposure misclassification, and possibility of chance findings.},

Areas covered: This review aims to describe the chemistry and pharmacology of LDX, as well as the clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of this medication for the management of BED. Expert opinion: LDX is the first medication with United States Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of BED. It is an inactive prodrug of d-amphetamine that extends the half-life of d-amphetamine to allow for once daily dosing. D-amphetamine acts primarily to increase the concentrations of synaptic dopamine and norepinephrine. Metabolism of LDX to d-amphetamine occurs when peptidases in red blood cells cleave the covalent bond between d-amphetamine and l-lysine. D-amphetamine is then further metabolized by CYP2D6. Excretion is primarily through renal mechanisms. In clinical trials, LDX demonstrated statistical and clinical superiority over placebo in reducing binge eating days per week at doses of 50 and 70 mg daily. Commonly reported side effects of LDX include dry mouth, insomnia, weight loss, and headache, and its use should be avoided in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart arrhythmia or coronary artery disease. As with all CNS stimulants, risk of abuse needs to be assessed prior to prescribing.},

In accordance with advice from the European Medicines Agency, assessment of cognitive function was a predefined safety outcome in SPD489-404. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess cognitive function over 2 years in study SPD489-404, using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). METHODS: Participants aged 6-17 years received dose-optimised open-label lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (30, 50 or 70 mg/day) for 104 weeks. Cognition was assessed using four CANTAB tasks; Delayed Matching to Sample (DMS), Spatial Working Memory (SWM), Stop Signal Task (SST) and Reaction Time (RTI). Key and additional variables were pre-specified for each CANTAB task; groupwise mean percentage changes in key variables from baseline of {\textgreater} 5\% were considered potentially clinically significant. RESULTS: All 314 enrolled participants received lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and were included in the safety population, and 191 (60.8\%) completed the study. No potentially clinically significant deteriorations from baseline were observed in any key CANTAB variable over the 2 years of the study. Based on predefined thresholds, potentially clinically significant improvements from baseline were observed at 6 months (DMS median reaction time, mean per cent change, - 6.6\%; SWM total between-search errors, - 22.8\%; SST stop signal reaction time, -18.9\%), and at the last on-treatment assessment (DMS median reaction time, - 6.5\%; SWM total between-search errors, - 32.6\%; SST stop signal reaction time, - 25.7\%). CONCLUSIONS: Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate treatment for 2 years was not associated with deterioration of cognitive function in children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Although improvements in some cognitive measures were observed, lack of a control group makes interpretation of the findings difficult.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is a once-daily medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children (aged 6-12 years) and adults. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties, clinical efficacy, and safety profile of LDX. METHODS: Studies, abstracts, reviews, and consensus statements published in English were identified through computerized searches of MEDLINE (1966-August 2008) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1977-August 2008) using search headings lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, NRP 104, NRP104-201, NRP104-301, NRP104-302, NRP104-303, and stimulant. Selected information provided by the manufacturer of LDX was included, as were all pertinent clinical trials. The reference lists of identified articles were also searched for pertinent information. Relevant abstracts presented at annual professional meetings were included as well. RESULTS: Several studies have evaluated the pharmacokinetics of LDX in pediatric patients (6-12 years of age) and healthy adults with ADHD. LDX, a prodrug that is therapeutically inactive until metabolized in the body to dextroamphetamine (d-amphetamine), follows linear pharmacokinetics at therapeutic doses (30-70 mg). The efficacy of LDX in the treatment of ADHD was established on the basis of 1 long-term and 2 short-term controlled clinical trials in children who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, criteria for ADHD (either the combined or the hyperactive-impulsive subtype) and in 1 clinical trial with adults with ADHD. The efficacy trials in children found significant improvements in scores on the Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham deportment sub-scales, the Permanent Product Measure of Performance (Attempted and Correct), and the ADHD Rating Scale Version IV (ADHD-RS-IV) compared with placebo (all, P {\textless} 0.001). In the clinical studies designed to measure duration of effect, LDX, compared with placebo, provided efficacy for a full treatment day, up through and including 6 PM, based on parent ratings (Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised Short Form) in the morning, afternoon, and early evening (all, P {\textless} 0.001). Data from a long-term, open-label extension study that assessed the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of LDX for up to 12 months found LDX treatment resulted in significant improvement ({\textgreater}60\%) from baseline in the ADHD-RS-IV at end point (P {\textless} 0.001), with good tolerability. The trial in adults found significant improvements in ADHD-RS scores at end point in patients receiving LDX (30,50, and 70 mg) (P {\textless} 0.001 for all active doses); significant improvements in ADHD-RS (using adult prompts) scores were observed at each postbaseline weekly assessment, with improvements noted within the first week in all active treatment arms. Results from human abuse liability studies noted that LDX had lower abuse-related drug-liking scores compared with immediate-release d-amphetamine at equivalent doses. The most common adverse events reported with LDX were typical of amphetamine products and included decreased appetite, insomnia, upper abdominal pain, headache, irritability, weight loss, and nausea. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence supports the efficacy and tolerability of LDX as a treatment option for the management of children (aged 6-12 years) and adults with ADHD. As such, LDX may be an integral part of a total treatment program for ADHD that can include other measures such as psychological, educational, and social interventions.},

Due to its long-acting properties, LDX remains pharmacologically inactive until an enzymatic process predominantly associated with red blood cells converts it to the active ingredient, d-amphetamine and the amino acid lysine. The efficacy of LDX over placebo has been demonstrated in several studies in adults with moderate to severe ADHD with significant improvements noted in ADHD rating scales, Clinical Global Improvement scores, and assessments of executive function, for all doses of LDX (30-70 mg daily). Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate has demonstrated efficacy at 14 hours post dose in adults and may be used as a long-acting stimulant for managing ADHD symptoms, which may extend late into the day. Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate has demonstrated a safety profile consistent with long-acting stimulants use.

This study tested the effect of the psychostimulant prodrug lisdexamfetamine dimesylate on amygdala activation and connectivity during the emotional bias of response execution and inhibition. METHODS: Twenty-five adults with ADHD were scanned twice with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing an emotional go/no-go task after 3 to 4 weeks of lisdexamfetamine treatment and 3 weeks off medication in a randomized, counterbalanced, hybrid crossover design. Drug, trial type, and face emotion (happy, sad, or neutral) were included as within-subjects factors in repeated measures analyses of activation and connectivity. RESULTS: Lisdexamfetamine was associated with increased right amygdala activation and reduced psychophysiological interactions with the orbital aspect of the left inferior frontal gyrus specifically for responses to sad faces compared with placebo, but there was no effect on the accuracy of response execution or inhibition. The relative gain in right amygdala activation in response to sad faces for lisdexamfetamine was correlated with a reduction in symptoms of ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with lisdexamfetamine potentiates affective encoding in amygdala, purportedly via catecholaminergic mechanisms, but functionally disconnects the amygdala from inferior frontal regions that encode behavioral significance-resulting in reduced emotional bias of cognitive control. Pinpointing the neurophysiologic underpinnings of therapeutic improvement with lisdexamfetamine represents a first step in developing targeted approaches to treatment of ADHD.},

In a randomized, double-blind study in healthy adult men (n = 135) undergoing 24-hour sleep loss, the alerting effects of single oral lisdexamfetamine dimesylate doses (20, 50, or 70 mg) were compared with a placebo and an active control (armodafinil 250 mg). Primary end point was mean unequivocal sleep latency on the 30-minute maintenance of wakefulness test taken every 2 hours from midnight to 8:00 A.M. Secondary end points included the Karolinska sleepiness scale and psychomotor vigilance task. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and vital signs.

METHODS: A PubMed search was conducted for English-language articles published up to 16 September 2013 using the following search terms: (lisdexamfetamine OR lisdexamphetamine OR SPD489 OR Vyvanse OR Venvanse OR NRP104 NOT review [publication type]). RESULTS: In short-term, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, phase III trials, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in children, adolescents, and adults receiving LDX were typical for those reported for stimulants in general. Decreased appetite was reported by 25-39 \% of patients and insomnia by 11-19 \%. The most frequently reported TEAEs in long-term studies were similar to those reported in the short-term trials. Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. Literature relating to four specific safety concerns associated with stimulant medications was evaluated in detail in patients receiving LDX. Gains in weight, height, and body mass index were smaller in children and adolescents receiving LDX than in placebo controls or untreated norms. Insomnia was a frequently reported TEAE in patients with ADHD of all ages receiving LDX, although the available data indicated no overall worsening of sleep quality in adults. Post-marketing survey data suggest that the rate of non-medical use of LDX was lower than that for short-acting stimulants and lower than or equivalent to long-acting stimulant formulations. Small mean increases were seen in blood pressure and pulse rate in patients receiving LDX. CONCLUSIONS: The safety and tolerability profile of LDX in individuals with ADHD is similar to that of other stimulants.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pericarditis may be a serious complication of malignancy. Its significance as a first symptom of occult cancer and as a prognostic factor for cancer survival is unknown. METHODS: Using Danish medical databases, we conducted a nationwide cohort study of all patients with a first-time diagnosis of pericarditis during 1994 to 2013. We excluded patients with previous cancer and followed up the remaining patients for subsequent cancer diagnosis until November 30, 2013. We calculated risks and standardized incidence ratios of cancer for patients with pericarditis compared with the general population. We assessed whether pericarditis predicts cancer survival by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression using a matched comparison cohort of cancer patients without pericarditis. RESULTS: Among 13 759 patients with acute pericarditis, 1550 subsequently were diagnosed with cancer during follow-up. The overall cancer standardized incidence ratio was 1.5 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-1.5), driven predominantly by increased rates of lung, kidney, and bladder cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, and unspecified metastatic cancer. The {\textless}3-month cancer risk among patients with pericarditis was 2.7\%, and the standardized incidence ratio was 12.4 (95\% CI, 11.2-13.7). The 3- to {\textless}12-month standardized incidence ratio of cancer was 1.5 (95\% CI, 1.2-1.7), subsequently decreasing to 1.1 (95\% CI, 1.0-1.2). Three-month survival after the cancer diagnosis was 80\% and 86\% among those with and without pericarditis, respectively, and the hazard ratio was 1.5 (95\% CI, 1.3-1.8). One-year survival was 65\% and 70\%, respectively, corresponding to a 3- to {\textless}12-month hazard ratio of 1.3 (95\% CI, 1.1-1.5).

At the date of confirmed ONJ diagnosis, the comparison cohort was matched to the ONJ patients on age, cancer site, year of cancer diagnosis, and stage at diagnosis. The patients were followed up for survival until emigration or 15 June 2016. We computed overall survival and estimated mortality rate ratios adjusted for sex, and for the presence of distant metastases and other comorbidity at start of follow-up. A match was found for 149 of the 184 ONJ patients. The 1- and 3-year survival among all 184 cancer patients with ONJ was 70\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 63\%-76\%) and 42\% (95\% CI: 34\%-51\%), respectively. Among the matched patients, ONJ was associated with an adjusted mortality rate ratio of 1.31 (95\% CI: 1.01-1.71).

There is an urgent need to identify markers of lung carcinogenesis and new targets for therapy. Given the recent successes of immune modulators in cancer therapy and the improved understanding of immune evasion by tumours, we sought to determine the carcinogenic impact of chronic TNF-alpha and IL-1beta exposure in a normal bronchial epithelial cell line model. Following three months of culture in a chronic inflammatory environment under conditions of normoxia and hypoxia (0.5\% oxygen), normal cells developed a number of key genotypic and phenotypic alterations. Important cellular features such as the proliferative, adhesive and invasive capacity of the normal cells were significantly amplified. In addition, gene expression profiles were altered in pathways associated with apoptosis, angiogenesis and invasion. The data generated in this study provides support that TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and hypoxia promotes a neoplastic phenotype in normal bronchial epithelial cells. In turn these mediators may be of benefit for biomarker and/or immune-therapy target studies. This project provides an important inflammatory in vitro model for further immuno-oncology studies in the lung cancer setting.},

Neutrophils are key players in the production of reactive oxygen species and carcinogenesis. Another aspect of pro-inflammatory cytokines is the induction of adhesion molecules and metalloproteinases, both of which provide mechanisms for tumor invasion. Blocking cytokines, however, will reduce tumor growth and spread if administered at sufficient concentrations and will require parenteral therapy.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied an inception cohort of patients with a first VTE who were not diagnosed with cancer within 3 months after VTE and who had follow-up for up to 120 months. We determined the annual risk for a new cancer [number of events and 95\% confidence interval (CI)] per 100 person-years in all patients and in those with unprovoked VTE and identified predictors for new cancer. RESULTS: We studied 1852 patients with VTE who received anticoagulant therapy for 12 months (mean) and were followed for 4.2 years (mean). During follow-up, there were 105 (5.7\%) patients diagnosed with new cancer during the period after the initial 3 months from diagnosis, for an annual risk of 1.32 (CI, 1.09-1.60) per 100 person-years. The risk for new cancer appeared uniform over time. The annual risk for new cancer was more than 2-fold higher in patients presenting with unprovoked compared with those with provoked VTE [1.76 (CI, 1.39-2.20) vs. 0.83 (CI, 0.58-1.16) per 100 person-years; P{\textless}0.001]. Clinical predictors for new cancer were increasing age [hazard ratio (HR), 1.23; CI, 1.05-1.44] and unprovoked VTE (HR, 1.86; CI, 1.21-2.87). CONCLUSION: In patients with a first VTE and without prevalent cancer, the risk for new cancer is about 1-2\% per year, appears to be uniform over time, and is higher in patients with unprovoked VTE and those with advanced age.},

	abstract = {Hemostasis encompasses the tightly regulated processes of blood clotting, platelet activation, and vascular repair. After wounding, the hemostatic system engages a plethora of vascular and extravascular receptors that act in concert with blood components to seal off the damage inflicted to the vasculature and the surrounding tissue. The first important component that contributes to hemostasis is the coagulation system, while the second important component starts with platelet activation, which not only contributes to the hemostatic plug, but also accelerates the coagulation system. Eventually, coagulation and platelet activation are switched off by blood-borne inhibitors and proteolytic feedback loops. This review summarizes new concepts of activation of proteases that regulate coagulation and anticoagulation, to give rise to transient thrombin generation and fibrin clot formation. It further speculates on the (patho)physiological roles of intra- and extravascular receptors that operate in response to these proteases. Furthermore, this review provides a new framework for understanding how signaling and adhesive interactions between endothelial cells, leukocytes, and platelets can regulate thrombus formation and modulate the coagulation process. Now that the key molecular players of coagulation and platelet activation have become clear, and their complex interactions with the vessel wall have been mapped out, we can also better speculate on the causes of thrombosis-related angiopathies.},

	abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Do mothers following assisted reproduction technology (ART) treatment have increased likelihood of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) compared with non-ART mothers after controlling for maternal factors and plurality? SUMMARY ANSWER: ART mothers had 28\% increased likelihood of GDM compared with non-ART mothers. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Advanced maternal age and multiple pregnancies are independently associated with increased likelihood of GDM. Given the average age of mothers having ART treatment is higher than non-ART mothers and the higher multiple pregnancy rate following ART treatment, ART treatment might be expected to be associated with increased risk of GDM. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A population retrospective cohort study of 400 392 mothers who gave birth in Australia between 2007 and 2009, using the Australian National Perinatal Data Collection from five states (Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia) where a code for ART treatment is available. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The study included 13 732 ART mothers and 386 660 non-ART mothers. The prevalence of GDM was compared between ART and non-ART mothers. Logistic regressions were used to assess the association between ART treatment and GDM. Odds ratio (OR), adjusted OR (AOR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A larger proportion of ART mothers were aged {\textgreater}/=40 years compared with non-ART counterpart (11.7 versus 3.4\%, P {\textless} 0.01). The prevalence of GDM was 7.6\% for ART mothers and 5.0\% for non-ART mothers (P {\textless} 0.01). Mothers who had twins had higher prevalence of GDM than those who gave births to singletons (8.8 versus 7.5\%, P = 0.06 for ART mothers; and 7.3 versus 5.0\%, P {\textless} 0.01 for non-ART mothers). Overall, ART mothers had a 28\% increased likelihood of GDM compared with non-ART mothers (AOR 1.28, 95\% CI 1.20-1.37). Of mothers who had singletons, ART mothers had higher odds of GDM than non-ART mothers (AOR 1.26, 95\% CI 1.18-1.36). There was no significant difference in the likelihood of GDM among mothers who had twins between ART and non-ART (AOR 1.18, 95\% CI 0.94-1.48). For mothers aged {\textless}40 years, the younger the maternal age, the higher the odds of GDM for ART singleton mothers compared with non-ART singleton mothers. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: It was not possible to investigate which ART procedure is associated with increased risk of GDM and how the risk could have been minimized. The information on BMI and smoking during pregnancy was not stated for a large proportion of mothers. These limitations may have reduced the validity of the study. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: In agreement with other studies, our data suggest that the underlying cause of subfertility and some particular ART procedures might have played an important role in the increased likelihood of GDM. Together with the public education on not delaying motherhood, minimizing multiple pregnancies by applying single embryo transfer may diminish the excess risk of GDM related to ART treatment.},

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. SETTING: Tertiary Department of Reproductive Endocrinology. PATIENT(S): Five thousand two hundred ninety-three pregnant women (721 with PCOS and 4,572 controls without PCOS). INTERVENTION(S): Literature search in the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL, study of the references of all relevant trials or reviews, and manual search of the abstracts from the major meetings in the field of human reproduction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Gestational diabetes mellitus odds ratio. RESULT(S): Women with PCOS demonstrated a significantly higher risk for the development of GDM as compared with women without PCOS (odds ratio 2.89, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.68-4.98), yet with significant statistical heterogeneity (I(2) = 59.3\%), durable to sensitivity analysis. In the subgroup of cohort studies, this finding remained robust (7.11, 95\% CI 2.95-17.12), whereas in the subgroup of case-control studies, it did not (0.89, 95\% CI 0.38-2.06). Metaregression modeling revealed a linear dependence of the outcome on study type and baseline risk (post hoc). CONCLUSION(S): Significant heterogeneity among studies and dependence of the outcome on study type make the higher risk of GDM in women with PCOS a questionable finding. The conduction of properly designed studies should precede any recommendation to pregnant women with PCOS in regard to the risk of GDM.},

POPULATION: All live singletons without congenital malformations in Denmark 2004-10. METHODS: Data on 366,886 singletons at 35(+0) to 41(+6) weeks(+days) of gestation were extracted and analysed using multivariate linear regressions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Birth AC and weight in relation to pregestational maternal BMI, maternal smoking and medical conditions (any). RESULTS: Birth AC and weight increased with increasing pregestational BMI, and decreased with smoking (P {\textless} 0.0001). Reference curves were created for offspring of healthy, nonsmoking mothers with normal pregestational BMI. Mean AC ranged from 30.1 cm and 30.2 cm at 35 weeks of gestation to 33.9 cm and 34.1 cm at 41 weeks of gestation, for girls and boys, respectively. Mean birthweight ranged from 2581 and 2666 g at 35 weeks to 3705 and 3852 g at 41 weeks of gestation for girls and boys, respectively. Pregestational BMI correlated more to the Z score of birthweight than to the Z score of AC (P {\textless} 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Birth AC and weight are affected by maternal smoking status and pregestational BMI. Pregestational BMI correlated more to birthweight than to AC.

Smoking as been associated with glucose intolerance during pregnancy in some but not all studies. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review all epidemiological evidence to examine the association between cigarette smoking during pregnancy and risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of articles published up to 2007, using PubMed, Embase, LILACS e CINAHL to identify the articles. Because this review focuses on studies of smoking during pregnancy, we excluded studies evaluating smoking outside pregnancy. Two investigators independently abstracted information on participant's characteristics, assessment of exposure and outcome, and estimates for the association under study. We evaluated the studies for publication bias and performed heterogeneity analyses. We also assessed the effect of each study individually through sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: We found and critically reviewed 32 studies, of which 12 met the criteria for inclusion in the review. Most of the studies provided only unadjusted measurements. Combining the results of the individual studies, we obtained a crude odds ratio of 1.03 (99\% CI 0.85-1.25). Only 4 studies presented adjusted measurements of association, and no association was found when these alone were analyzed (OR 0.95; 99\% CI 0.85-1.07). Subgroup analysis could not be done due to small sample size. CONCLUSION: The number of studies is small, with major heterogeneity in research design and findings. Taken together, current data do not support an association between cigarette smoking during pregnancy and the risk of gestational diabetes.},

METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study including 225,973 women with 322,224 pregnancies in British Columbia, Canada, between 2002 and 2011. Women were categorized according to whether they had late-pregnancy exposure (at least 15 of the last 30 days of pregnancy), midpregnancy exposure (in the last 5 months of pregnancy but not the final 30 days), or no exposure. Postpartum hemorrhage was identified using International Classification of Diseases (9th and 10th Revisions) codes in data on all hospitalizations. RESULTS: We found an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage associated with exposure to an serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor in the final month of pregnancy after adjustment for potential confounders (n=1,390; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.76, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.47-2.11, respectively) corresponding to 4.1 (95\% CI 2.4-5.7) additional cases of postpartum hemorrhage per 100 people treated. There was no significant relationship between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use in the final month of pregnancy and postpartum hemorrhage (n=6,637; adjusted OR 1.09, 95\% CI 0.98-1.21), except when confining the cohort to women with complete body mass index (BMI) information (n=235,031 [73\%]) and controlling for BMI (adjusted OR 1.14, 95\% CI 1.01-1.28) or when controlling for variables that are possibly on the causal pathway (adjusted OR 1.13, 95\% CI 1.02-1.26). Midpregnancy exposure to a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (n=242) or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (n=1,507) was not associated with an increased postpartum hemorrhage risk. CONCLUSION: Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor exposure in late pregnancy was associated with a 1.6- to 1.9-fold increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage.},

	abstract = {An obstetric hemorrhage may occur before or after delivery, but more than 80\% of cases occur postpartum. Worldwide, a massive obstetric hemorrhage, resulting from the failure of normal obstetrical, surgical and/or systemic hemostasis, is responsible for 25\% of the estimated 358,000 maternal deaths each year. Most women will not have identifiable risk factors. Nonetheless, primary prevention of a postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) begins with an assessment of identifiable risk factors. Women identified as being at high risk of a PPH should be delivered in a center with access to adequately trained staff and an onsite blood bank. A critical feature of a massive hemorrhage in obstetrics is the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which, in contrast to DIC that develops with hemorrhage from surgery or trauma, is frequently an early feature. Data from clinical trials to guide management of transfusion in PPH are lacking. There are likely to be similarities in the management of transfusion in severe PPH to that of major bleeding in other clinical situations, but the pathophysiological processes that contribute to a massive PPH may necessitate different transfusion strategies such as the ratio of red blood cells to plasma components, in particular fibrinogen. Caution should be exercised when considering the appropriate place for recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in the management of a major PPH. An early hysterectomy is recommended for severe bleeding as a result of placenta accreta or uterine rupture. However, in women with uterine atony who have ongoing bleeding in spite of an adequate transfusion, it may be reasonable to consider a trial of rFVIIa before a hysterectomy.},

All patients were referred by a high-risk obstetrician or reproductive medicine specialist after anatomic, hormonal or chromosomal defects had been ruled out. These patients were assessed over a three year period. The mean patient age at referral was 34 years and the mean number of miscarriages was 2.9 (2-9). All patients underwent a thorough evaluation for thrombophilia and, when indicated, a hemorrhagic disorder. Of the 351 patients, 29 (8\%) had no defect. Of the remaining 322 patients, 7 (2\%) had a bleeding disorder: 3 with platelet dysfunction, 1 with Factor XIII deficiency, 3 with von Willebrand's and 3 with Osler-Weber-Rendu. The remainder of the patients had a thrombophilia as follows: 195 (60\%) had antiphospholipid syndrome, 64 (20\%) had Sticky Platelet Syndrome, 38 (12\%) had MTHFR mutation, 23 (7.1\%) had PAI-1 polymorphism, 12 (3.7\%) had Protein S deficiency, 12 (3.7\%) had Factor V Leiden, 3 (1\%), had AT deficiency, 3 (1\%) had Heparin-Cofactor II deficiency, 3 (1\%) had TPA deficiency, and 6 (2\%) had Protein C deficiency. There were a total of 364 defects found in the 312 patients harboring thrombophilia; thus, several harbored two and a few harbored three separate defects. All patients with thrombophilia were treated with preconception ASA at 81 mg/day with the immediate post-conception addition of heparin or LMW heparin (Dalteparin). Both ASA and heparin/LMW heparin were used to term. The first 120 patients were treated with unfractionated heparin at 5,000 U every 24 hours, subcutaneously and the last 192 have been treated with Dalteparin at 5,000 U/day subcutaneously. The patients with MTHFR were also treated with folate at 5 mg/day + pyridoxine at 50 mg/day. All patients were carefully monitored with CBC and platelet counts, anti-Xa levels, frequent ultrasounds and physical exams. Only 2 of the thrombophilia patients suffered another miscarriage; all others had a normal term delivery. There were no pregnancy-related thromboses, no delivery complications and no episodes of post-partum thrombosis. The only bleeding consisted of 1-4 cm bruises at injection sites. No episodes of thrombocytopenia (HIT) were noted. In our experience, thrombophilia is a common cause of recurrent miscarriage and all patients with no anatomical, hormonal or chromosomal defect should be evaluated for thrombophilia or a bleeding disorder. The success rate of normal term delivery in these 312 patients was 94\% using ASA + heparin or Dalteparin. In addition, side effects of therapy were minimal.},

	abstract = {Despite the growing popularity of propensity score (PS) methods in epidemiology, relatively little has been written in the epidemiologic literature about the problem of variable selection for PS models. The authors present the results of two simulation studies designed to help epidemiologists gain insight into the variable selection problem in a PS analysis. The simulation studies illustrate how the choice of variables that are included in a PS model can affect the bias, variance, and mean squared error of an estimated exposure effect. The results suggest that variables that are unrelated to the exposure but related to the outcome should always be included in a PS model. The inclusion of these variables will decrease the variance of an estimated exposure effect without increasing bias. In contrast, including variables that are related to the exposure but not to the outcome will increase the variance of the estimated exposure effect without decreasing bias. In very small studies, the inclusion of variables that are strongly related to the exposure but only weakly related to the outcome can be detrimental to an estimate in a mean squared error sense. The addition of these variables removes only a small amount of bias but can increase the variance of the estimated exposure effect. These simulation studies and other analytical results suggest that standard model-building tools designed to create good predictive models of the exposure will not always lead to optimal PS models, particularly in small studies.},

Propensity scores (PSs), an alternative to multivariable outcome models to control for measured confounding, have specific advantages in the presence of heterogeneous treatment effects. Implementing PSs using matching or weighting allows us to estimate different overall treatment effects in differently defined populations. Heterogeneous treatment effects can also be due to unmeasured confounding concentrated in those treated contrary to prediction. Sensitivity analyses based on PSs can help to assess such unmeasured confounding. PSs should be considered a primary or secondary analytic strategy in nonexperimental medical research, including pharmacoepidemiology and nonexperimental comparative effectiveness research.},

In the present counterpoint article, a range of problems in pharmacoepidemiology that do not necessarily require that observation begin at first exposure are discussed. For example, among patients who are past or current users of a medication, we might want to know whether treatment should be augmented, switched, restarted, or discontinued. To answer these questions, a generalization of the new-user design, the treatment decision design, which identifies cohorts anchored at times when treatment decisions are being made, such as the evaluation of laboratory parameters, is discussed. The design aims to provide estimates that are directly relevant to physicians and patients, helping them to better understand the risks and benefits of the different treatment choices that they are considering.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To add to the evidence on comparative long-term effects of insulin analog glargine versus human NPH insulin on the risk for cancer. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified cohorts of initiators of glargine and human NPH without an insulin prescription during the prior 19 months among patients covered by the Inovalon Medical Outcomes Research for Effectiveness and Economics Registry (MORE2 Registry) between January 2003 and December 2010. Patients were required to have a second prescription of the same insulin within 180 days and to be free of cancer. We balanced cohorts on risk factors for cancer outcomes based on comorbidities, comedication, and health care use during the prior 12 months using inverse probability of treatment weighting. Incident cancer was defined as having two claims for cancer (any cancer) or the same cancer (breast, prostate, colon) within 2 months. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95\% CI using weighted Cox models censoring for stopping, switching, or augmenting insulin treatment, end of enrollment, and mortality. RESULTS: More patients initiated glargine (43,306) than NPH (9,147). Initiators of glargine (NPH) were followed for 1.2 (1.1) years and 50,548 (10,011) person-years; 993 (178) developed cancer. The overall HR was 1.12 (95\% CI 0.95-1.32). Results were consistent for breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer; various durations of treatment; and sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Patients initiating insulin glargine rather than NPH do not seem to be at an increased risk for cancer. While our study contributes significantly to our evidence base for long-term effects, this evidence is very limited mainly based on actual dynamics in insulin prescribing.},

	doi = {10.1093/ije/dyi274},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous observational studies have reported that seniors who receive influenza vaccine are at substantially lower risk of death and hospitalization during the influenza season than unvaccinated seniors. These estimates could be influenced by differences in underlying health status between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. Since a protective effect of vaccination should be specific to influenza season, evaluation of non-influenza periods could indicate the possible contribution of bias to the estimates observed during influenza season. METHODS: We evaluated a cohort of 72,527 persons 65 years of age and older followed during an 8 year period and assessed the risk of death from any cause, or hospitalization for pneumonia or influenza, in relation to influenza vaccination, in periods before, during, and after influenza seasons. Secondary models adjusted for covariates defined primarily by diagnosis codes assigned to medical encounters. RESULTS: The relative risk of death for vaccinated persons compared with unvaccinated persons was 0.39 [95\% confidence interval (95\% CI), 0.33-0.47] before influenza season, 0.56 (0.52-0.61) during influenza season, and 0.74 (0.67-0.80) after influenza season. The relative risk of pneumonia hospitalization was 0.72 (0.59-0.89) before, 0.82 (0.75-0.89) during, and 0.95 (0.85-1.07) after influenza season. Adjustment for diagnosis code variables resulted in estimates that were further from the null, in all time periods. CONCLUSIONS: The reductions in risk before influenza season indicate preferential receipt of vaccine by relatively healthy seniors. Adjustment for diagnosis code variables did not control for this bias. In this study, the magnitude of the bias demonstrated by the associations before the influenza season was sufficient to account entirely for the associations observed during influenza season.},

A growing body of research has identified sources of bias in observational studies that are related to patient behaviors or underlying patient characteristics, known as the healthy user effect, the healthy adherer effect, confounding by functional status or cognitive impairment, and confounding by selective prescribing. In this manuscript we briefly review observational studies of prevention that have appeared to reach incorrect conclusions. We then describe potential sources of bias in these studies and discuss study designs, analytical methods, and sensitivity analyses that may mitigate bias or increase confidence in the results reported. More careful consideration of these sources of bias and study designs by providers can enhance evidence-based decision-making.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few medicines have been approved for children, leading to rates of off-label prescribing reported to be as high as 90\%. In 2007, the European Union adopted the Paediatric Regulation, which mandates that pharmaceutical companies conduct paediatric studies for all new medicines, unless granted a waiver. We aimed to evaluate the availability of paediatric trial results from studies required under the Paediatric Regulation for new medicines authorised in the EU. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The European Medicines Agency (EMA) public database of paediatric investigation plans was searched for new medicines centrally authorised in the EU between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2014 with at least 1 required paediatric study. For our study cohort of paediatric clinical trials required for these medicines, we used internal EMA databases and publicly available trial registries to determine changes to the planned completion date or study design, rates of trial completion, time to trial completion, and results reporting (peer-reviewed publication or posting on trial registry). Cox proportional hazards regression models were constructed to examine factors associated with study completion. A total of 326 paediatric clinical trials were required for 122 novel medicines authorised by the EMA between 2010 and 2014. In all, 76\% (247/326) of paediatric studies were not planned to be completed until after the initial marketing authorisation. The planned completion dates for 50\% (162/326) were further postponed by a median of 2.2 years. Overall, 38\% (124/326) of paediatric studies were completed as of 30 November 2017. The rate of trial completion for paediatric studies planned to be completed after initial marketing authorisation was 23\% (56/247), versus 86\% (68/79) for trials planned to be completed before authorisation (adjusted hazard ratio 0.11; 95\% CI 0.06-0.19). Among completed studies, the results were reported in a public registry or in the peer-reviewed literature for 85\% (105/124) at a median of 1.1 years after study completion, and 60\% (74/124) were published in a peer-reviewed journal. Limitations of this study include the potential lack of generalisability to medicines not authorised by the EMA and the possibility for more of these trials to be completed or published in the future. CONCLUSIONS: The completion of many paediatric studies required under the Paediatric Regulation has been delayed. Paediatric studies planned to be completed after marketing authorisation were associated with a lower likelihood of eventual completion, highlighting the need to examine the implementation of current policies in ensuring timely availability of important paediatric information.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Regulatory agencies and other stakeholders increasingly rely on data collected through registries to support their decision-making. Data from registries are a cornerstone of post-marketing surveillance for monitoring the use of medicines in clinical practice. This study was aimed at gaining further insight into the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) requests for new registries and registry studies using existing registries and to review the experience gained in their conduct. METHODS: European Public Assessment Reports were consulted to identify products for which a request for a registry was made as a condition of the marketing authorisation. All centrally authorised products that received a positive opinion of the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2013 were included. Data regarding registry design and experiences were collected from EMA electronic record keeping systems. RESULTS: Of 392 products that received a positive Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use opinion during 2005-2013, 31 registries were requested for 30 products in total. Sixty-five percent were product registries whereas 35\% were disease registries and 71\% of the registries had a primary safety objective. Most commonly reported issues with registries were delayed time to start and low patient accrual rates. CONCLUSIONS: The delays found in getting new registries up and running support the need to improve the timeliness of data collection in the post-marketing setting. Methodological challenges met in conducting this study highlighted the need for a clarification of definitions and epidemiological concepts around patient registries. The results will inform the EMA Patient Registry initiative to support use of existing patient registries for the post-authorisation benefit-risk monitoring of medicinal products.

A recent update of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences International Ethical Guidelines for Health-Related Research Involving Humans provides further clarification on provisions for informed consent and the role of research ethics committees. However, without incorporation into legislative structures, the future impact of these guidelines is uncertain. This lack of harmonization leads to a complex and uncertain framework for ethical review and for participant informed consent, resulting in numerous inefficiencies in the regulatory postmarketing observational studies.

It is often an unmeasured confounder in pharmacoepidemiologic and comparative effectiveness studies using administrative claims data. METHODS: Among the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study Visit 5 participants (2011-2013; n=3146), we conducted a validation study to compare a Medicare claims-based algorithm of dependency in activities of daily living (or dependency) developed as a proxy for frailty with a reference standard measure of phenotypic frailty. We applied the algorithm to the ARIC participants' claims data to generate a predicted probability of dependency. Using the claims-based algorithm, we estimated the c-statistic for predicting phenotypic frailty. We further categorized participants by their predicted probability of dependency ({\textless}5\%, 5\% - {\textless}20\%, and {\textgreater} 20\%) and estimated associations with difficulties in physical abilities, falls, and mortality. RESULTS: The claims-based algorithm showed good discrimination of phenotypic frailty (c-statistic=0.71, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.67, 0.74). Participants classified with a high predicted probability of dependency ({\textgreater}20\%) had higher prevalence of falls and difficulty in physical ability, and a greater risk of one-year all-cause mortality (hazard ratio=5.7 (95\% CI: 2.5, 13) than participants classified with a low predicted probability ({\textless}5\%). Sensitivity and specificity varied across predicted probability of dependency thresholds. CONCLUSION: The Medicare claims-based algorithm showed good discrimination of phenotypic frailty and high predictive ability with adverse health outcomes. This algorithm can be used in future Medicare claims analyses to reduce confounding by frailty and improve study validity.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Few studies have evaluated the degree to which prescription drug initiators are correctly identified using claims data. We examine the prevalence and predictors of recent statin possession in statin initiators identified using claims data. METHODS: Among Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) respondents, we used Medicare Part D claims from 2006 to 2011 to identify statin initiators using a 12-month baseline period of no prior statin claims. Using MCBS interview data, we identified those with self-reported statins obtained during the baseline period. We used log-binomial regression to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (adjPR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for predictors of recent statin possession. RESULTS: Among 766 statin initiators identified in prescription claims, 155 (20\%) reported recent statin possession during baseline. Beneficiaries with no Part D claims in the past 30 days (adjPR = 1.49, 95\%CI: 1.13, 1.96), those with no inpatient, outpatient or physician visits in the past 30 days (adjPR = 1.50, 95\%CI: 1.11, 2.03), those with a brand name statin index claim (adjPR = 1.55, 95\%CI: 1.19, 2.02), and those with an index claim in January or February (adjPR = 1.50, 95\%CI: 1.00, 2.26) had an increased probability of recent statin possession. CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of statin initiators identified using prescription claims, 20\% had evidence of statin possession during the baseline period. Pharmacoepidemiologic new user studies may benefit from including sensitivity analyses within subgroups less likely to include prevalent users to assess the robustness of key findings to misidentification of the time of treatment initiation.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies of prescription medications increasingly rely on large administrative health care databases. These data do not capture patients' use of medication samples. This could potentially bias studies of short-term effects where date of initiation may be inaccurate. OBJECTIVES: To assess the extent of sample use among patients initiating statin therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN: Retrospective cohort of patients who filled a first prescription for a statin after at least 6 months of statin-free period in 2007-2010. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) values obtained within the 15 days preceding the first prescription were analyzed using a 2-component Gaussian mixture model to look for evidence of prior treatment. SUBJECTS: A total of 26,033 statin initiators with at least 1 LDL laboratory result within the 15 days preceding the prescription fill. MEASURES: Estimators for the proportion of patients filling a new prescription already on treatment. RESULTS: Among 9256 patients filling a branded statin, LDL distribution was bimodal, consisting of 2 Gaussian distributions: one, which made up 13.4\% of the total population, had much lower LDL values (mean=71.8 mg/dL) compared with the second (mean=148.0 mg/dL), suggesting drug use before first dispensed prescription. Among 16,777 patients filling a generic statin, LDL levels were substantially higher with no evidence of bimodality that would suggest prior sample use. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide indirect evidence that the initial period of branded medication use may often be missed when using pharmacy claims data to define drug initiation. Further research is needed to examine approaches to better identify incident medication use when assessing short-term effects.},

We aimed to validate claims-based myocardial infarction (MI) algorithms in a Medicaid population using an HIV clinical cohort as the gold standard. METHODS: Medicaid administrative data were obtained for the years 2002-2008 and linked to the UNC CFAR HIV Clinical Cohort based on social security number, first name, and last name and MI were adjudicated. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated. RESULTS: There were 1063 individuals included in the study. Over a median observed time of 2.5 years, 17 had an MI. Specificity ranged from 0.979 to 0.993 with the highest specificity obtained using the ICD-9 code 410.xx in the primary or secondary position and a length of stay {\textgreater}3 days. Sensitivity of MI ascertainment varied from 0.588 to 0.824 depending on algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: Specificities of varying claims-based MI ascertainment criteria are high but small changes impact positive predictive value in a cohort with low incidence. Sensitivities vary based on ascertainment criteria. Type of algorithm used should be prioritized based on study question and maximization of specific validation parameters that will minimize bias while also considering precision.},

However, linkage between cancer registry and claims data including pharmacy-dispensing information is not always available. We examined the accuracy of claims-based definitions of incident cancers and their date of diagnosis. METHODS: Four claims-based definitions were developed to identify incident leukemia, lymphoma, lung, colorectal, stomach, and breast cancer. We identified a cohort of subjects aged {\textgreater}or=65 (1997-2000) from Pennsylvania Medicare and drug benefit program data linked with the state cancer registry. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of the claims-based definitions using registry as the gold standard. We further assessed the agreement between diagnosis dates from two data sources. RESULTS: All definitions had very high specificity ({\textgreater}or=98\%), while sensitivity varied between 40\% and 90\%. Test characteristics did not vary systematically by age groups. The date of first diagnosis according to Medicare data tended to be later than the date recorded in the registry data except for breast cancer. The differences in dates of first diagnosis were within 14 days for 75\% to 88\% of the cases. Bias due to outcome misclassification of our claims-based definition of cancer was minimal in our example of a cohort study. CONCLUSIONS: Claims data can identify incident hematologic malignancies and solid tumors with very high specificity with sufficient agreement in the date of first diagnosis. The impact of bias due to outcome misclassification and thus the usefulness of claims-based cancer definitions as cancer outcome markers in etiologic studies need to be assessed for each study setting.},

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We use real studies to illustrate the variety of uses of automated health care data in epidemiologic and health services research. Hypothetical examples show the impact of different types of misclassification when algorithms are used to ascertain exposure and outcome. RESULTS: High algorithm sensitivity is important for reducing the costs and burdens associated with the use of a more accurate measurement tool, for enhancing study inclusiveness, and for ascertaining common exposures. High specificity is important for classifying outcomes. High positive predictive value is important for identifying a cohort of persons with a condition of interest but that need not be representative of or include everyone with that condition. Finally, a high negative predictive value is important for reducing the likelihood that study subjects have an exclusionary condition. CONCLUSION: Epidemiologists must often prioritize one measure of accuracy over another when generating an algorithm for use in their study. We recommend researchers publish all tested algorithms-including those without acceptable accuracy levels-to help future studies refine and apply algorithms that are well suited to their objectives.},

However, the potential effectiveness of histamine H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) in humans with heart failure is largely unknown. We examined the association between H2RA initiation and all-cause mortality among patients with heart failure. Methods: Using Danish medical registries, we conducted a nationwide population-based active-comparator cohort study of new users of H2RAs and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) after first-time hospitalization for heart failure during the period 1995-2014. Hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality and hospitalization due to worsening of heart failure, adjusting for age, sex, and time between heart failure diagnosis and initiation of PPI or H2RA therapy, index year, comorbidity, cardiac surgery, comedications, and socioeconomic status were computed based on Cox regression analysis. Results: Our analysis included 42,902 PPI initiators (median age 78 years, 46\% female) and 3,296 H2RA initiators (median age 76 years, 48\% female). Mortality risk was lower among H2RA initiators than PPI initiators after 1 year (26\% vs 31\%) and 5 years (60\% vs 66\%). In multivariable analyses, the 1-year HR was 0.80 (95\% CI, 0.74-0.86) and the 5-year HR was 0.85 (95\% CI, 0.80-0.89). These findings were consistent after propensity score matching and for ischemic and nonischemic heart failure, as for sex and age groups. The rate of hospitalization due to worsening of heart failure was lower among H2RA initiators than PPI initiators. Conclusion: In patients with heart failure, H2RA initiation was associated with 15\%-20\% lower mortality than PPI initiation.},

	abstract = {Quantitative bias analysis serves several objectives in epidemiological research. First, it provides a quantitative estimate of the direction, magnitude and uncertainty arising from systematic errors. Second, the acts of identifying sources of systematic error, writing down models to quantify them, assigning values to the bias parameters and interpreting the results combat the human tendency towards overconfidence in research results, syntheses and critiques and the inferences that rest upon them. Finally, by suggesting aspects that dominate uncertainty in a particular research result or topic area, bias analysis can guide efficient allocation of sparse research resources. The fundamental methods of bias analyses have been known for decades, and there have been calls for more widespread use for nearly as long. There was a time when some believed that bias analyses were rarely undertaken because the methods were not widely known and because automated computing tools were not readily available to implement the methods. These shortcomings have been largely resolved. We must, therefore, contemplate other barriers to implementation. One possibility is that practitioners avoid the analyses because they lack confidence in the practice of bias analysis. The purpose of this paper is therefore to describe what we view as good practices for applying quantitative bias analysis to epidemiological data, directed towards those familiar with the methods. We focus on answering questions often posed to those of us who advocate incorporation of bias analysis methods into teaching and research. These include the following. When is bias analysis practical and productive? How does one select the biases that ought to be addressed? How does one select a method to model biases? How does one assign values to the parameters of a bias model? How does one present and interpret a bias analysis?. We hope that our guide to good practices for conducting and presenting bias analyses will encourage more widespread use of bias analysis to estimate the potential magnitude and direction of biases, as well as the uncertainty in estimates potentially influenced by the biases.},

Medical databases and population surveillance registries are valuable resources for post-approval observational research, which are increasingly used in studies of benefits and risk of new cancer drugs. Here, we address the challenges in translating endpoints from oncology trials to observational studies. Registry-based cohort studies can investigate real-world safety issues - including previously unrecognized concerns - by examining rare endpoints or multiple endpoints at once. In contrast to clinical trials, observational cohort studies typically do not exclude real-world patients from clinical practice, such as old and frail patients with comorbidity. The observational cohort study complements the clinical trial by examining the effectiveness of interventions applied in clinical practice and by providing evidence on long-term clinical outcomes, which are often not feasible to study in a clinical trial. Various endpoints can be included in clinical trials, such as hard endpoints, soft endpoints, surrogate endpoints, and patient-reported endpoints. Each endpoint has it strengths and limitations for use in research studies. Endpoints used in oncology trials are often not applicable in observational cohort studies which are limited by the setting of standard clinical practice and by non-standardized endpoint determination. Observational studies can be more helpful moving research forward if they restrict focus to appropriate and valid endpoints.},

However, although many have noted problems with the peer-review system for both manuscripts and grant submissions, few solutions have been proposed to improve the process. Quantitative bias analysis encompasses all methods used to quantify the impact of systematic error on estimates of effect in epidemiologic research. Reviewers who insist that quantitative bias analysis be incorporated into the design, conduct, presentation, and interpretation of epidemiologic research could substantially strengthen the process. In the present commentary, we demonstrate how quantitative bias analysis can be used by investigators and authors, reviewers, funding agencies, and editors. By utilizing quantitative bias analysis in the peer-review process, editors can potentially avoid unnecessary rejections, identify key areas for improvement, and improve discussion sections by shifting from speculation on the impact of sources of error to quantification of the impact those sources of bias may have had.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Validation data are used to estimate the extent of misclassification in epidemiologic studies. In the Penn MOMS cohort, prepregnancy body mass index is subject to misclassification, and validation data are available to estimate the extent of misclassification. We use these data to estimate the association between maternal prepregnancy body mass index and early preterm ({\textless}32 weeks) birth using a semi-Bayes hierarchical model, allowing for more flexible adjustment for misclassification. METHODS: We propose a two-stage model that first fits a Bayesian hierarchical model for the bias parameters in the validation study. This model shrinks bias parameters in different groups toward one another in an effort to gain precision and improve mean squared error. In the second stage, we draw random samples from the posterior distribution of the bias parameters to implement a probabilistic bias analysis adjusting for exposure misclassification in a frequentist outcome model. RESULTS: Bias parameters from the hierarchical model were often more substantively reasonable and often had smaller variance. Adjusting results for misclassification generally attenuated the strength of the unadjusted associations. After adjusting for misclassification, underweight mothers were not at increased risk of early preterm birth relative to normal weight mothers. Severely obese mothers had an increased risk of early preterm birth relative to normal weight mothers. CONCLUSIONS: The two-stage semi-Bayesian hierarchical model borrowed strength between group-specific bias parameters to adjust for exposure misclassification. Model results support evidence of an increased risk of early preterm birth among severely obese mothers, relative to normal weight mothers.},

OBJECTIVE: To assess the use of topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus in children and adults in Europe. METHODS: Multicentre database cohort study comprising data from the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and the UK. We analysed users of topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus starting from the date of first availability (between 2002 and 2003) or start establishment of the prescription database in Sweden (2006) through 2011. Use was assessed separately for children ({\textless}/= 18 years) and adults. RESULTS: 32,052 children and 104,902 adults were treated with topical tacrolimus, and 32,125 children and 58,280 adults were treated with topical pimecrolimus. The number of users increased rapidly after first availability, especially for topical tacrolimus. Topical tacrolimus was more frequently used in all countries except Denmark. For both drugs, there was a decrease in users after 2004 in the Netherlands and Denmark and after 2005 in the UK, especially among children. This decrease was largest in Denmark. The decrease in the number of users was temporary for topical tacrolimus, while use remained relatively low for topical pimecrolimus. CONCLUSIONS: The number of topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus users increased rapidly after regulatory approval. A transient reduction in topical tacrolimus use and a persistent reduction in topical pimecrolimus use was seen after 2004 in the Netherlands and Denmark and after 2005 in the UK.},

	abstract = {Epithelial ovarian cancer is a fatal disease of largely unknown etiology. Higher parity is associated with reduced risk of ovarian cancer. However, among parous women, the impact of pregnancy-related factors on risk is not well understood. This population-based case-control study included all parous women with epithelial ovarian cancer in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden during 1967-2013 (n=10,957) and up to 10 matched controls (n=107,864). We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for pregnancy-related factors and ovarian cancer risk by histological subtype. Preterm delivery was associated with an increased risk [pregnancy length (last pregnancy) {\textless}/=30 versus 39-41 weeks, OR 1.33 (95\%CI 1.06-1.67), adjusted for number of births]; the OR increased as pregnancy length decreased (p for trend{\textless}0.001). Older age at first and last birth were associated with a decreased risk [first birth: 30-39 versus {\textless}25 years: adjusted OR 0.76 (95\%CI 0.70-0.83); last birth 30-39 versus {\textless}25 years: adjusted OR 0.76 (95\%CI 0.71-0.82)]. Increasing number of births was protective [{\textgreater}/=4 births versus 1; OR 0.63 (95\%CI 0.59-0.68)] for all subtypes, most pronounced for clear-cell tumors [OR 0.30, (95\%CI 0.21-0.44), p-heterogeneity{\textless}0.001]. No associations were observed for multiple pregnancies, preeclampsia or offspring size. In conclusion, in addition to high parity, full-term pregnancies and pregnancies at older ages were associated with decreased risk of ovarian cancer. Our findings favor the cell clearance hypothesis, i.e. a recent pregnancy provides protection by clearing of precancerous cells from the epithelium of the ovary/fallopian tubes, mediated by placental or ovarian hormones.

	abstract = {Malignancy affects the hemostatic system and the hemostatic system affects malignancy. In cancer patients there are a number of coagulation abnormalities which provide the background for an increased tendency of these patients to both thrombosis and hemorrhage. The causes of this coagulation impairment rely on general risk factors which are common to other categories of patients, and other factors which are specific to cancer, such as tumor type and disease stage. In addition, data from basic research indicate that the hemostatic components and the cancer biology are interconnected in multiple ways. Notably, while cancer cells are able to activate the coagulation system, the hemostatic factors play a role in tumor progression. This opens the way to the development of bifunctional therapeutic approaches that are both capable of attacking the malignant process and resolving the coagulation impairment. On the other hand, the management of thrombosis and hemorrhages in cancer patients can be different. To approach these problems, some guidelines have been released by prominent international scientific societies. Also actively investigated is the issue of identifying new biomarkers to classify the subjects at a higher risk, thus improving the prevention of thrombohemorrhagic events in these patients. Finally, novel prophylactic and therapeutic approaches are currently under development. This review provides an overview of the hemostatic complications in cancer, together with new insights into the interaction between hemostasis and cancer biology. We also review the assessment of the risk of thrombohemorrhagic events in cancer patients, and the prophylaxis and treatment of such manifestations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of epilepsy and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used during pregnancy on fetal growth and preterm delivery. METHODS: This study included singleton liveborn infants born to women enrolled in the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry between 1997 and 2016. Data were collected prospectively through telephone interviews. The prevalence of preterm birth ({\textless}37 weeks) and small for gestational age status (SGA) among infants exposed prenatally to AEDs when used by women with epilepsy (WWE) or women without epilepsy (WWOE) was compared with that among infants unexposed to AEDs and born to WWOE. Multivariate log-binomial regression models were used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The study population included infants born to 6,777 AED-WWE, 696 AED-WWOE, and 486 no-AED-WWOE. The risk of prematurity was 6.2\% for no-AED-WWOE, 9.3\% for AED-WWE (RR = 1.5, 95\% CI = 1.0-2.1), and 10.5\% for AED-WWOE (RR = 1.5, 95\% CI = 1.0-2.4). Prenatal exposure to AEDs in WWE and WWOE was associated with a mean lower birth weight of 110 and 136g, respectively, as compared to no-AED-WWOE. The prevalence of SGA was 5.0\% for no-AED-WWOE, 10.9\% for AED-WWE (RR = 2.0, 95\% CI = 1.3-3.0), and 11.0\% for AED-WWOE (RR = 1.9, 95\% CI = 1.2-2.9). Within users of AEDs in monotherapy, the prevalence of SGA ranged from 7.3\% for lamotrigine to 18.5\% for topiramate. INTERPRETATION: Women on AEDs during pregnancy, whether for epilepsy or for other neuropsychiatric indications, are at a higher risk of delivering prematurely and giving birth to SGA newborns.

In this review, we first discuss biases that may affect pharmacoepidemiologic studies and describe their direction and magnitude in a variety of settings. We then present the historical foundations of the active comparator, new user study design and explain how this design conceptually mitigates biases leading to a paradigm shift in pharmacoepidemiology.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Some atypical antipsychotics are associated with metabolic side effects, which are risk factors for gestational diabetes. The authors examined the risk of developing gestational diabetes associated with the continuation of treatment with aripiprazole, ziprasidone, quetiapine, risperidone, and olanzapine during pregnancy compared with discontinuation of these antipsychotic drugs. METHOD: Nondiabetic pregnant women who were linked to a live-born infant and enrolled in Medicaid (2000-2010) and who received one or more prescriptions dispensed for an antipsychotic drug during the 3 months before pregnancy were included in the analyses. Among 1,543,334 pregnancies, some expectant mothers at baseline were receiving treatment with aripiprazole (N=1,924), ziprasidone (N=673), quetiapine (N=4,533), risperidone (N=1,824), or olanzapine (N=1,425). For each antipsychotic drug, women with two or more dispensings ("continuers") were compared with women with no dispensings ("discontinuers") during the first half of pregnancy. A generalized linear model and propensity-score stratification were used to obtain absolute and relative risks of developing gestational diabetes, with adjustment for confounders. RESULTS: Women who continued antipsychotic treatment during pregnancy generally had higher comorbidity and longer baseline antipsychotic use. The crude risk of developing gestational diabetes among continuers compared with discontinuers, respectively, was 4.8\% and 4.5\% for aripiprazole, 4.2\% and 3.8\% for ziprasidone, 7.1\% and 4.1\% for quetiapine, 6.4\% and 4.1\% for risperidone, and 12.0\% and 4.7\% for olanzapine. The adjusted relative risks were 0.82 (95\% CI=0.50-1.33) for aripiprazole, 0.76 (95\% CI=0.29-2.00) for ziprasidone, 1.28 (95\% CI=1.01-1.62) for quetiapine, 1.09 (95\% CI=0.70-1.70) for risperidone, and 1.61 (95\% CI=1.13-2.29) for olanzapine. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with women who discontinued use of an atypical antipsychotic medication before the start of pregnancy, women who continued treatment with olanzapine or quetiapine had an increased risk of gestational diabetes that may be explained by the metabolic effects associated with these two drugs.},

Main Outcomes and Measures: The association between maternal vitamin supplementation and the risk of ASD in offspring was quantified with relative risks (RRs) and their 95\% CIs fitting Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for confounders. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. Results: Of the 45300 children in the study (22090 girls and 23210 boys; mean [SD] age, 10.0 [1.4] years at the end of follow-up), 572 (1.3\%) received a diagnosis of ASD. Maternal exposure to folic acid and/or multivitamin supplements before pregnancy was statistically significantly associated with a lower likelihood of ASD in the offspring compared with no exposure before pregnancy (RR, 0.39; 95\% CI, 0.30-0.50; P {\textless} .001). Maternal exposure to folic acid and/or multivitamin supplements during pregnancy was statistically significantly associated with a lower likelihood of ASD in offspring compared with no exposure during pregnancy (RR, 0.27; 95\% CI, 0.22-0.33; P {\textless} .001). Corresponding RRs were estimated for maternal exposure to folic acid before pregnancy (RR, 0.56; 95\% CI, 0.42-0.74; P = .001), maternal exposure to folic acid during pregnancy (RR, 0.32; 95\% CI, 0.26-0.41; P {\textless} .001), maternal exposure to multivitamin supplements before pregnancy (RR, 0.36; 95\% CI, 0.24-0.52; P {\textless} .001), and maternal exposure to multivitamin supplements during pregnancy (RR, 0.35; 95\% CI, 0.28-0.44; P {\textless} .001). The results generally remained statistically significant across sensitivity analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: Maternal exposure to folic acid and multivitamin supplements before and during pregnancy is associated with a reduced risk of ASD in the offspring compared with the offspring of mothers without such exposure.},

Objective: To determine the effectiveness of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening after 15 years of follow-up in women and men. Design: Randomized controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00119912). Setting: Oslo and Telemark County, Norway. Participants: Adults aged 50 to 64 years at baseline without prior CRC. Intervention: Screening (between 1999 and 2001) with flexible sigmoidoscopy with and without additional fecal blood testing versus no screening. Participants with positive screening results were offered colonoscopy. Measurements: Age-adjusted CRC incidence and mortality stratified by sex. Results: Of 98 678 persons, 20 552 were randomly assigned to screening and 78 126 to no screening. Adherence rates were 64.7\% in women and 61.4\% in men. Median follow-up was 14.8 years. The absolute risks for CRC in women were 1.86\% in the screening group and 2.05\% in the control group (risk difference, -0.19 percentage point [95\% CI, -0.49 to 0.11 percentage point]; HR, 0.92 [CI, 0.79 to 1.07]). In men, the corresponding risks were 1.72\% and 2.50\%, respectively (risk difference, -0.78 percentage point [CI, -1.08 to -0.48 percentage points]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [CI, 0.57 to 0.78]) (P for heterogeneity = 0.004). The absolute risks for death of CRC in women were 0.60\% in the screening group and 0.59\% in the control group (risk difference, 0.01 percentage point [CI, -0.16 to 0.18 percentage point]; HR, 1.01 [CI, 0.77 to 1.33]). The corresponding risks for death of CRC in men were 0.49\% and 0.81\%, respectively (risk difference, -0.33 percentage point [CI, -0.49 to -0.16 percentage point]; HR, 0.63 [CI, 0.47 to 0.83]) (P for heterogeneity = 0.014). Limitation: Follow-up through national registries. Conclusion: Offering sigmoidoscopy screening in Norway reduced CRC incidence and mortality in men but had little or no effect in women.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Blocking muscarinic receptors could have an effect upon cardiac function, especially among elderly patients with overactive bladder (OAB). STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk of cardiovascular events in users of antimuscarinic drugs to treat OAB. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort study of new users of darifenacin, fesoterodine, oxybutynin, solifenacin, tolterodine, or trospium, aged {\textgreater}/=18 years old in the United Kingdom's Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), 2004-2012. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Using tolterodine as the reference, we estimated propensity-score-stratified incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for acute myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality, major adverse cardiac events (MACE, a combined endpoint of the previous three), and all-cause death for individual antimuscarinic drugs. The study cohort included 119,912 new users of OAB drugs. The mean age at cohort entry was 62 years, 70\% were female, and the mean follow-up was 3.3 years. The adjusted IRR (95\% confidence interval) for MACE and current use of oxybutynin compared with current use of tolterodine was 1.14 (1.01-1.30). In contrast, it was 0.65 (0.56-0.76) for current use of solifenacin compared to tolterodine. In this study, performed with health care data, the distribution of risk factors was relatively similar across users of different OAB drugs and, although our analyses controlled for a range of measured potential confounders, residual confounding cannot be ruled out. CONCLUSIONS: In an observational comparative study of users of medications to treat OAB conducted in routine clinical practice, the risk for cardiovascular side effects was increased in users of oxybutynin and decreased in users of solifenacin compared with users of tolterodine.

For dichotomous variables, misclassification is nonindependent when the probability of misclassification of one variable is dependent on the correctness of classification of the other variable. One plausible form of nonindependent misclassification may result from variation in the threshold for reporting exposure and outcome by study subjects. The odds ratio after dependent misclassification can be expressed as a function of the true odds ratio, the prevalences of exposure and outcome, and the probabilities of misclassification. When prevalences of exposure and outcome are low, bias may be considerable even at low probabilities of misclassification. The nonindependent misclassification described in this article will result in a positive bias in the odds ratio and is therefore of prime concern when questioning the validity of an observed effect. The core of the problem lies in the study design and can be solved by eliminating the common link that makes nonindependent errors possible.},

In reaction, guidelines for journals have been promulgated and grant applicants have been asked to address the rigor and reproducibility of their proposed projects. Neither solution addresses a primary culprit, which is the culture of null hypothesis significance testing that dominates statistical analysis and inference. In an innovative research enterprise, selection of results for further evaluation based on null hypothesis significance testing is doomed to yield a low proportion of reproducible results and a high proportion of effects that are initially overestimated. In addition, the culture of null hypothesis significance testing discourages quantitative adjustments to account for systematic errors and quantitative incorporation of prior information. These strategies would otherwise improve reproducibility and have not been previously proposed in the widely cited literature on this topic. Without discarding the culture of null hypothesis significance testing and implementing these alternative methods for statistical analysis and inference, all other strategies for improving reproducibility will yield marginal gains at best.},

PATIENT(S): A total of 3,521 singletons born to women aged 18-40 years at cohort entry. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Selected birth outcomes, including preterm birth (PTB, {\textless}37 weeks' gestation), low birth weight ({\textless}2,500 g), small for gestational age, large for gestational age, and placental disorders, ascertained from the Danish Medical Birth Registry and Danish National Registry of Patients. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using log-binomial regression, with adjustment for potential confounders and fertility treatment. RESULT(S): Multivariable RRs for PTB in relation to TTP of 3-5, 6-11, and {\textgreater}/=12 vs. {\textless}3 cycles were 1.59 (95\% CI 0.94-2.69), 0.85 (95\% CI 0.48-1.50), and 1.57 (95\% CI 0.93-2.65).

We, therefore examined the association between hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and breast cancer risk. DESIGN: This was a population-based cohort study. METHODS: Using nationwide registries, we identified all women in Denmark with a first-time hospital diagnosis of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, 1978-2013. We estimated the excess risk of breast cancer among patients with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism compared with the expected risk in the general population, using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) as a measure of risk ratio. Breast cancer diagnoses in the first 12 months following diagnosis of thyroid disease were excluded from the calculations to avoid diagnostic work-up bias. RESULTS: We included 61, 873 women diagnosed with hypothyroidism and 80, 343 women diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. Median follow-up time was 4.9 years (interquartile range (IQR): 1.8-9.5 years) for hypothyroidism and 7.4 years (IQR: 3.1-13.5 years) for hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism was associated with a slightly increased breast cancer risk compared with the general population (SIR: 1.11, 95\% CI: 1.07-1.16), which persisted beyond 5 years of follow-up (SIR: 1.13, 95\% CI: 1.08-1.19). In comparison, hypothyroidism was associated with a slightly lower risk of breast cancer (SIR: 0.94, 95\% CI: 0.88-1.00). Stratification by cancer stage at diagnosis, estrogen receptor status, age, comorbidity, history of alcohol-related disease and clinical diagnoses of obesity produced little change in cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: We found an increased risk of breast cancer in women with hyperthyroidism and a slightly decreased risk in women with hypothyroidism indicating an association between thyroid function level and breast cancer risk.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between prepregnancy obesity and maternal outcomes. METHODS: A 15-year, population-based cohort study using the Nova Scotia Atlee Perinatal Database compared maternal outcomes in obese and nonobese women. Prepregnancy weight of 55-75 kg was considered nonobese, and weight greater than 90 kg was considered obese. Obese women were categorized into moderate obesity (90-120 kg) and severe obesity ({\textgreater} 120 kg) groups. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed, and odds ratios (ORs), adjusted ORs, and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. P {\textless} .05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In 142,404 singleton pregnancies, 10,134 (7.2\%) women were identified as obese (moderate obesity 92.3\%, severe obesity 7.7\%). The proportion of women in the obese categories increased from 3.2\% in 1988 to 10.2\% in 2002. Moderately obese women had an increased risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) (adjusted OR 2.38, 95\% CI 2.24-2.52), antepartum venous thromboembolism (adjusted OR 2.17, 95\% CI 1.30-3.63), labor induction (adjusted OR 1.94, 95\% CI 1.86-2.04), cesarean delivery (adjusted OR 1.60, 95\% CI 1.53-1.67), and wound infection (adjusted OR 1.67, 95\% CI 1.38-2.00). Severely obese women had an increased risk of PIH (adjusted OR 3.00, 95\% CI 2.49-3.62), antepartum venous thromboembolism (adjusted OR 4.13, 95\% CI 1.26-13.54), induction of labor (adjusted OR 2.77, 95\% CI 2.39-3.21), cesarean delivery (adjusted OR 2.46, 95\% CI 2.15-2.81), anesthesia complications (adjusted OR 2.01, 95\% CI 1.33-3.06), and wound infection (adjusted OR 4.79, 95\% CI 3.30-6.95). This implies that, relative to nonobese women, there was 1 excess case of PIH per 10 moderately obese women and 1 per 7 severely obese women. For antepartum venous thromboembolism, there was 1 excess case per 857 moderately obese women and 1 per 321 severely obese women. CONCLUSION: Prepregnancy maternal obesity increases the risk of PIH, antepartum venous thromboembolism, labor induction, cesarean delivery, and wound infection.},

	abstract = {Noncausal associations between exposures and outcomes are a threat to validity of causal inference in observational studies. Many techniques have been developed for study design and analysis to identify and eliminate such errors. Such problems are not expected to compromise experimental studies, where careful standardization of conditions (for laboratory work) and randomization (for population studies) should, if applied properly, eliminate most such noncausal associations. We argue, however, that a routine precaution taken in the design of biologic laboratory experiments--the use of "negative controls"--is designed to detect both suspected and unsuspected sources of spurious causal inference. In epidemiology, analogous negative controls help to identify and resolve confounding as well as other sources of error, including recall bias or analytic flaws. We distinguish 2 types of negative controls (exposure controls and outcome controls), describe examples of each type from the epidemiologic literature, and identify the conditions for the use of such negative controls to detect confounding. We conclude that negative controls should be more commonly employed in observational studies, and that additional work is needed to specify the conditions under which negative controls will be sensitive detectors of other sources of error in observational studies.},

	abstract = {An understanding of the origin of cancer is critical for cancer prevention and treatment. Complex biological mechanisms promote carcinogenesis, and there is increasing evidence that pregnancy-related exposures influence foetal growth cell division and organ functioning and may have a long-lasting impact on health and disease susceptibility in the mothers and offspring. Nulliparity is an established risk factor for breast, ovarian, endometrial and possibly pancreatic cancer, whilst the risk of kidney cancer is elevated in parous compared with nulliparous women. For breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer, each pregnancy provides an additional risk reduction. The associations of parity with thyroid and colorectal cancers are uncertain. The timing of reproductive events is also recognized to be important. Older age at first birth is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, and older age at last birth is associated with a reduced risk of endometrial cancer. The risks of breast and endometrial cancers increase with younger age at menarche and older age at menopause. The mechanisms, and hormone profiles, that underlie alterations in maternal cancer risk are not fully understood and may differ by malignancy. Linking health registries and pooling of data in the Nordic countries have provided opportunities to conduct epidemiologic research of pregnancy exposures and subsequent cancer. We review the maternal risk of several malignancies, including those with a well-known hormonal aetiology and those with less established relationships. The tendency for women to have fewer pregnancies and at later ages, together with the age-dependent increase in the incidence of most malignancies, is expected to affect the incidence of pregnancy-associated cancer.},

Few studies have assessed whether thyroid dysfunction and thyroid autoimmunity influence this risk. Objective: To examine thyroid cancer risk following diagnoses of a wide range of benign thyroid conditions. Design: Hospital and cancer registry linkage cohort study for the years 1978-2013. Setting: Nationwide (Denmark). Participants: Patients diagnosed with hyperthyroidism (n=85,169), hypothyroidism (n=63,143), thyroiditis (n=12,532), nontoxic nodular goiter (n=65,782), simple goiter (n=11,582), other/unspecified goiter (n=21,953), or adenoma (n=6,481) among 8,258,807 residents of Denmark during the study period. Main Outcome Measures: We computed standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for differentiated thyroid cancer, excluding the first 12 months of follow-up after benign thyroid disease diagnosis. Results: SIRs were significantly elevated for all benign thyroid diseases apart from hypothyroidism. SIRs were higher for men than women and in the earlier follow-up periods. Elevated SIRs were observed for localized and regional/distant thyroid cancer. After excluding the first 10 years of follow-up, hyperthyroidism (n=27 thyroid cancer cases, SIR=2.00, 95\% CI 1.32-2.92), nontoxic nodular goiter (n=83, SIR=4.91, 95\% CI 3.91-6.09), simple goiter (n=8, SIR=4.33, 95\% CI 1.87-8.53), other/unspecified goiter (n=20, SIR=3.94, 95\% CI 2.40-6.08), and adenoma (n=9, SIR=6.02, 95\% CI 2.76-11.5) remained positively associated with thyroid cancer risk. Conclusions: We found an unexpected increased risk of differentiated thyroid cancer, including regional/distant disease, following diagnosis of hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis that could not be solely attributed to increased medical surveillance. Hypothyroidism was less clearly associated with thyroid cancer risk.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although adjustment disorder is common, there is a dearth of research on its physical health consequences. Earlier studies, biological mechanisms and stress-related behaviors suggest that cancer may be a potential sequelae of adjustment disorder. This study examined the association between adjustment disorder and type-specific cancer incidence in a nationwide cohort. METHODS: Data were obtained from the comprehensive nationwide medical and administrative registries of Denmark. We calculated the incidence of type-specific cancers from 1995 to 2013 in patients with a prior adjustment disorder diagnosis (n = 58,712), and compared it with the incidence in the general population by calculating standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with accompanying 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). SIRs were adjusted using semi-Bayes shrinkage. RESULTS: The SIR for any type of cancer was 1.0 (95\% CI: 0.99, 1.1). Adjustment disorder was associated with a 10\% lower rate of immune-related cancers (SIR = 0.9, 95\% CI: 0.84, 0.97) and with a 20\% higher rate of smoking- and alcohol-related cancers (SIR = 1.2, 95\% CI: 1.1, 1.3). We found null associations for hematological (SIR = 1.1, 95\% CI: 0.89, 1.3) and hormone-related (SIR = 0.98, 95\% CI: 0.91, 1.1) malignancies. After semi-Bayes adjustment, type-specific cancer SIRs indicated no association between adjustment disorder and cancer incidence. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides persuasive evidence for a null association between adjustment disorder and type-specific cancer incidence in a nationwide study cohort.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Primary postpartum hemorrhage is a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity internationally. Research comparing physiological (expectant) and active management of the third stage of labor favors active management, although studies to date have focused on childbirth within hospital settings, and the skill levels of birth attendants in facilitating physiological third stage of labor have been questioned. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of place of birth on the risk of postpartum hemorrhage and the effect of mode of management of the third stage of labor on severe postpartum hemorrhage. METHODS: Data for 16,210 low-risk women giving birth in 2006 and 2007 were extracted from the New Zealand College of Midwives research database. Modes of third stage management and volume of blood lost were compared with results adjusted for age, parity, ethnicity, smoking, length of labor, mode of birth, episiotomy, perineal trauma, and newborn birthweight greater than 4,000 g. RESULTS: In total, 1.32 percent of this low-risk cohort experienced an estimated blood loss greater than 1,000 mL. Place of birth was not found to be associated with risk of blood loss greater than 1,000 mL. More women experienced blood loss greater than 1,000 mL in the active management of labor group for all planned birth places. In this low-risk cohort, those women receiving active management of third stage of labor had a twofold risk (RR: 2.12, 95\% CI: 1.39-3.22) of losing more than 1,000 mL blood compared with those expelling their placenta physiologically. CONCLUSIONS: Planned place of birth does not influence the risk of blood loss greater than 1,000 mL. In this low-risk group active management of labor was associated with a twofold increase in blood loss greater than 1,000 mL compared with physiological management. (BIRTH 39:2 June 2012).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: All obese pregnant women are considered at equal high risk with respect to complications in pregnancy and birth, and are commonly managed through resource-intensive care pathways. However, the identification of maternal characteristics associated with normal pregnancy outcomes could assist in the management of these pregnancies. The present study aims to identify the factors associated with uncomplicated pregnancy and birth in obese women, and to assess their predictive performance. METHODS: Data form obese women (BMI {\textgreater}/= 30 kg/m(2)) with singleton pregnancies included in the UPBEAT trial were used in this analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic, clinical and biochemical factors at 15(+0) to 18(+6) weeks' gestation associated with uncomplicated pregnancy and birth, defined as delivery of a term live-born infant without antenatal or labour complications. Predictive performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Internal validation and calibration were also performed. Women were divided into fifths of risk and pregnancy outcomes were compared between groups. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated using the upper fifth as the positive screening group. RESULTS: Amongst 1409 participants (BMI 36.4, SD 4.8 kg/m(2)), the prevalence of uncomplicated pregnancy and birth was 36\% (505/1409). Multiparity and increased plasma adiponectin, maternal age, systolic blood pressure and HbA1c were independently associated with uncomplicated pregnancy and birth. These factors achieved an AUROC of 0.72 (0.68-0.76) and the model was well calibrated. Prevalence of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders, preterm birth, and postpartum haemorrhage decreased whereas spontaneous vaginal delivery increased across the fifths of increasing predicted risk of uncomplicated pregnancy and birth. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 38\%, 89\%, 63\% and 74\%, respectively. A simpler model including clinical factors only (no biomarkers) achieved an AUROC of 0.68 (0.65-0.71), with sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 31\%, 86\%, 56\% and 69\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Clinical factors and biomarkers can be used to help stratify pregnancy and delivery risk amongst obese pregnant women. Further studies are needed to explore alternative pathways of care for obese women demonstrating different risk profiles for uncomplicated pregnancy and birth.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Atonic postpartum hemorrhage rates have increased in many industrialized countries in recent years. We examined the blood loss, risk factors, and management of the third stage of labour associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage. METHODS: We carried out a case-control study of patients in eight tertiary care hospitals in Canada between January 2011 and December 2013. Cases were defined as women with a diagnosis of atonic postpartum hemorrhage, and controls (without postpartum hemorrhage) were matched with cases by hospital and date of delivery. Estimated blood loss, risk factors, and management of the third stage labour were compared between cases and controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to adjust for confounding. RESULTS: The study included 383 cases and 383 controls. Cases had significantly higher mean estimated blood loss than controls. However, 16.7\% of cases who delivered vaginally and 34.1\% of cases who delivered by Caesarean section (CS) had a blood loss of {\textless} 500 mL and {\textless} 1000 mL, respectively; 8.2\% of controls who delivered vaginally and 6.7\% of controls who delivered by CS had blood loss consistent with a diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage. Factors associated with atonic postpartum hemorrhage included known protective factors (e.g., delivery by CS) and risk factors (e.g., nulliparity, vaginal birth after CS). Uterotonic use was more common in cases than in controls (97.6\% vs. 92.9\%, P {\textless} 0.001). Delayed cord clamping was only used among those who delivered vaginally (7.7\% cases vs. 14.6\% controls, P = 0.06). CONCLUSION: There is substantial misclassification in the diagnosis of atonic postpartum hemorrhage, and this could potentially explain the observed temporal increase in postpartum hemorrhage rates.},

METHOD: The study population included women who participated in a randomized controlled trial of women with singleton low-risk pregnancy who delivered vaginally after 35 weeks' gestation (n = 3917). Clinical PPH was defined as postpartum blood loss {\textgreater}/= 500 mL measured by using a collector bag and UPPBL was defined by a peripartum change in haemoglobin {\textgreater}/= 2 g/dL in the absence of clinical PPH. Risk factors were assessed by multivariate multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: The incidence of UPPBL and PPH was 11.2\% and 11.0\% of vaginal deliveries, respectively. The median peripartum change in Hb level was comparable between UPPBL and PPH groups (2.5 g/dL interquartile range [2.2-3.0] and 2.4 g/dL IQR [1.5-3.3]). Risk factors specifically associated with UPPBL were Asian geographical origin (adjusted OR [aOR] 2.3, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-4.2; p = 0.009), previous caesarean section (aOR 3.4, 2.1-5.5; p{\textless}0.001) and episiotomy (aOR 2.6, 1.8-3.6; p{\textless}0.001). Risk factors for both UPPBL and PPH were primiparity, long duration of labour, instrumental delivery and retained placenta. CONCLUSION: Undiagnosed abnormal postpartum blood loss is frequent among women giving birth vaginally and has specific risk factors. The clinical importance of this entity needs further confirmation, and the benefit of systematic or targeted prevention strategies needs to be assessed.},

We therefore examined cancer risk and prognosis of cancer in patients with lower limb arterial thrombosis. Methods -Using nationwide population-based Danish medical registries, we identified all patients diagnosed with first-time lower limb arterial thrombosis (1994-2013) and followed them until the occurrence of any subsequent cancer diagnosis, emigration, death, or 30 November 2013, whichever came first. We computed standardized incidence ratios with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) as the observed number of cancers relative to the expected number based on national incidence rates by sex, age, and calendar year. To examine the prognostic impact of lower limb arterial thrombosis on all-cause mortality after cancer, we constructed a matched comparison cohort of cancer patients without lower limb arterial thrombosis. Results -Among 6600 patients with lower limb arterial thrombosis, we observed 772 subsequent cancers. The risk of any cancer was 2.5\% after 6 months of follow-up, increasing to 17.9\% after 20 years. During the first 6 months of follow-up, the standardized incidence ratio of any cancer was 3.28 (95\% CI: 2.79-3.82). The standardized incidence ratio remained elevated during 7-12 months (1.42, 95\% CI: 1.09-1.83) and beyond 12 months (1.14, 95\% CI: 1.05-1.24). The strongest associations were found for lung cancer and other smoking-related cancers. Lower limb arterial thrombosis also was associated with increased all-cause mortality after colon, lung, urinary bladder, and breast cancer, but not after prostate cancer. Conclusions -Lower limb arterial thrombosis was a marker of occult cancer, especially lung cancer, and was an adverse prognostic factor for mortality in common cancers.},

Correspondingly, migraine was positively associated with myocardial infarction (adjusted hazard ratio 1.49, 95\% confidence interval 1.36 to 1.64), ischaemic stroke (2.26, 2.11 to 2.41), and haemorrhagic stroke (1.94, 1.68 to 2.23), as well as venous thromboembolism (1.59, 1.45 to 1.74) and atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (1.25, 1.16 to 1.36). No meaningful association was found with peripheral artery disease (adjusted hazard ratio 1.12, 0.96 to 1.30) or heart failure (1.04, 0.93 to 1.16). The associations, particularly for stroke outcomes, were stronger during the short term (0-1 years) after diagnosis than the long term (up to 19 years), in patients with aura than in those without aura, and in women than in men. In a subcohort of patients, the associations persisted after additional multivariable adjustment for body mass index and smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Migraine was associated with increased risks of myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, venous thromboembolism, and atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Migraine may be an important risk factor for most cardiovascular diseases.},

DESIGN: Multicountry population based cohort study, including sibling controlled design. SETTING: Nordic population (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) identified from nationwide health registers at different periods in 1996-2010. POPULATION: The full study cohort included women giving birth to 2.3 million live singletons. The sibling cohort included 2288 singleton live births. The sibling controlled analyses included sibling pairs who were discordant for exposure to SSRIs or venlafaxine and birth defects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Prevalence of birth defects, including subtypes of cardiac defects. Odds ratio of birth defects from logistic and conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 36,772 infants exposed to any SSRI in early pregnancy, 3.7\% (n=1357) had a birth defect compared with 3.1\% of 2,266,875 unexposed infants, yielding a covariate adjusted odds ratio of 1.13 (95\% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.20). In the sibling controlled analysis the adjusted odds ratio decreased to 1.06 (0.91 to 1.24). The odds ratios for any cardiac birth defect with use of any SSRI or venlafaxine were 1.15 (95\% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.26) in the covariate adjusted analysis and 0.92 (0.72 to 1.17) in the sibling controlled analysis. For atrial and ventricular septal defects the covariate adjusted odds ratio was 1.17 (1.05 to 1.31). Exposure to any SSRI or venlafaxine increased the prevalence of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction defects, with a covariate adjusted odds ratio of 1.48 (1.15 to 1.89). In the sibling controlled analysis the adjusted odds ratio decreased to 0.56 (0.21 to 1.49) for any exposure to SSRIs or venlafaxine and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction defects. CONCLUSIONS: In this large Nordic study no substantial increase was found in prevalence of overall cardiac birth defects among infants exposed to SSRIs or venlafaxine in utero. Although the prevalence of septal defects and right ventricular outflow tract defects was higher in exposed infants, the lack of an association in the sibling controlled analyses points against a teratogenic effect of these drugs.},

Medical records were retrieved and VTE diagnoses were verified by one of the authors using a standard protocol. The positive predictive value (PPV) of a discharge diagnosis of VTE was calculated as percent of registry diagnoses with the corresponding true diagnosis in the chart among all registry diagnoses. RESULTS: We retrieved medical records from 1,100 of 1,135 participants (96.9\%) registered with a discharge diagnosis of VTE; 626 diagnoses were confirmed and 17 were considered probable. The PPV of diagnoses coded at wards was 75.0\% (95\% confidence interval: 71.9, 77.9). Diagnoses from emergency departments were not valid. The PPV varied by type of VTE (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), type of diagnosis (primary or secondary), and sex.

We define overadjustment bias as control for an intermediate variable (or a descending proxy for an intermediate variable) on a causal path from exposure to outcome. We define unnecessary adjustment as control for a variable that does not affect bias of the causal relation between exposure and outcome but may affect its precision. We use causal diagrams and an empirical example (the effect of maternal smoking on neonatal mortality) to illustrate and clarify the definition of overadjustment bias, and to distinguish overadjustment bias from unnecessary adjustment. Using simulations, we quantify the amount of bias associated with overadjustment. Moreover, we show that this bias is based on a different causal structure from confounding or selection biases. Overadjustment bias is not a finite sample bias, while inefficiencies due to control for unnecessary variables are a function of sample size.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A previous analysis of the Osteoarthritis Initiative study reported a dose-response relationship between physical activity and improved physical function in adults with knee osteoarthritis, using conventional statistical methods. These methods are subject to bias when confounders are affected by prior exposure. METHODS: We used baseline and 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-up data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative study of 2545 US adults with knee osteoarthritis recruited between 2004 and 2006 from 4 clinical sites. Physical activity was measured using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly, and outcomes were functional performance measured by the timed 20-meter walk test and self-reported knee pain measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. We estimated the effect of physical activity on each outcome using inverse probability-weighted (IPW) estimators of marginal structural models. For each outcome, we fitted 2 separate IPW models adjusting for concurrent or lagged confounders. RESULTS: The mean differences in walking speed for the second, third, and fourth quartiles of physical activity relative to the first were 0.48 (95\% confidence interval = -0.12 to 1.08), 0.45 (-0.23 to 1.13), and 0.46 (-0.29 to 1.22) meters/min based on the IPW model adjusting for concurrent confounders. When adjusting for lagged confounders, the results were 1.35 (0.64 to 2.07), 1.33 (0.54 to 2.14), and 1.26 (0.40 to 2.12). Both IPW models indicated that physical activity did not affect knee pain. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity has no effect on knee pain and may have either a very small effect or no effect on functional performance in adults with knee osteoarthritis.},

Marginal structural models are a new class of causal models the parameters of which are estimated through inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting; these models allow for appropriate adjustment for confounding. We describe the marginal structural Cox proportional hazards model and use it to estimate the causal effect of zidovudine on the survival of human immunodeficiency virus-positive men participating in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. In this study, CD4 lymphocyte count is both a time-dependent confounder of the causal effect of zidovudine on survival and is affected by past zidovudine treatment. The crude mortality rate ratio (95\% confidence interval) for zidovudine was 3.6 (3.0-4.3), which reflects the presence of confounding. After controlling for baseline CD4 count and other baseline covariates using standard methods, the mortality rate ratio decreased to 2.3 (1.9-2.8). Using a marginal structural Cox model to control further for time-dependent confounding due to CD4 count and other time-dependent covariates, the mortality rate ratio was 0.7 (95\% conservative confidence interval = 0.6-1.0). We compare marginal structural models with previously proposed causal methods.},

Unlike the setting of a single point exposure (e.g., propensity score matching), there are few tools to describe confounding for joint exposures or how well a method resolves it. Investigators need tools that describe confounding in ways that are conceptually grounded and intuitive for those who read, review, and use applied research to guide policy. We revisit the implications of exchangeability conditions that hold in sequentially randomized trials, and the bias structure that motivates the use of g-methods, such as marginal structural models. From these, we develop covariate balance diagnostics for joint exposures that can (1) describe time-varying confounding, (2) assess whether covariates are predicted by prior exposures given their past, the indication for g-methods, and (3) describe residual confounding after inverse probability weighting. For each diagnostic, we present time-specific metrics that encompass a wide class of joint exposures, including regimes of multivariate time-varying exposures in censored data, with multivariate point exposures as a special case. We outline how to estimate these directly or with regression and how to average them over person-time. Using a simulated example, we show how these metrics can be presented graphically. This conceptually grounded framework can potentially aid the transparent design, analysis, and reporting of studies that examine joint exposures. We provide easy-to-use tools to implement it.},

The causal inference literature has not, however, produced a clear formal definition of a confounder, as it has given priority to the concept of confounding over that of a confounder. We consider a number of candidate definitions arising from various more informal statements made in the literature. We consider the properties satisfied by each candidate definition, principally focusing on (i) whether under the candidate definition control for all "confounders" suffices to control for "confounding" and (ii) whether each confounder in some context helps eliminate or reduce confounding bias. Several of the candidate definitions do not have these two properties. Only one candidate definition of those considered satisfies both properties. We propose that a "confounder" be defined as a pre-exposure covariate C for which there exists a set of other covariates X such that effect of the exposure on the outcome is unconfounded conditional on (X, C) but such that for no proper subset of (X, C) is the effect of the exposure on the outcome unconfounded given the subset.

	abstract = {This paper addresses strategies for selecting variables for adjustment in non-experimental comparative effectiveness research and uses causal graphs to illustrate the causal network that relates treatment to outcome. Variables in the causal network take on multiple structural forms. Adjustment for a common cause pathway between treatment and outcome can remove confounding, whereas adjustment for other structural types may increase bias. For this reason, variable selection would ideally be based on an understanding of the causal network; however, the true causal network is rarely known. Therefore, we describe more practical variable selection approaches based on background knowledge when the causal structure is only partially known. These approaches include adjustment for all observed pretreatment variables thought to have some connection to the outcome, all known risk factors for the outcome, and all direct causes of the treatment or the outcome. Empirical approaches, such as forward and backward selection and automatic high-dimensional proxy adjustment, are also discussed. As there is a continuum between knowing and not knowing the causal, structural relations of variables, we recommend addressing variable selection in a practical way that involves a combination of background knowledge and empirical selection and that uses high-dimensional approaches. This empirical approach can be used to select from a set of a priori variables based on the researcher's knowledge to be included in the final analysis or to identify additional variables for consideration. This more limited use of empirically derived variables may reduce confounding while simultaneously reducing the risk of including variables that may increase bias.},

In recent years, several published estimates of the effect of time-varying exposures have been based on weighted estimation of the parameters of marginal structural models because, unlike standard statistical methods, weighting can appropriately adjust for measured time-varying confounders affected by prior exposure. As an example, the authors describe the last three assumptions using the change in viral load due to initiation of antiretroviral therapy among 918 human immunodeficiency virus-infected US men and women followed for a median of 5.8 years between 1996 and 2005. The authors describe possible tradeoffs that an epidemiologist may encounter when attempting to make inferences. For instance, a tradeoff between bias and precision is illustrated as a function of the extent to which confounding is controlled. Weight truncation is presented as an informal and easily implemented method to deal with these tradeoffs. Inverse probability weighting provides a powerful methodological tool that may uncover causal effects of exposures that are otherwise obscured.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Pragmatic randomized trials are important tools for shared decision-making, but no guidance exists on patients' preferences for types of causal information. We aimed to assess preferences of patients and investigators towards causal effects in pragmatic randomized trials. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We: (a) held 3 focus groups with patients (n=23) in Boston, MA; (b) surveyed (n=12) and interviewed (n=5) investigators with experience conducting pragmatic trials; and (c) conducted a systematic literature review of pragmatic trials (n=63). RESULTS: Patients were distrustful of new-to-market medications unless substantially more effective than existing choices, preferred stratified absolute risks, and valued adherence-adjusted analyses when they expected to adhere. Investigators wanted both intention-to-treat and per-protocol effects, but felt methods for estimating per-protocol effects were lacking. When estimating per-protocol effects, many pragmatic trials used inappropriate methods to adjust for adherence and loss to follow-up. CONCLUSION: We make 4 recommendations for pragmatic trials to improve patient centeredness: (1) focus on superiority in effectiveness or safety, rather than noninferiority; (2) involve patients in specifying a priori subgroups; (3) report absolute measures of risk, and (4) complement intention-to-treat effect estimates with valid per-protocol effect estimates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The time taken, or 'time lags', between biomedical/health research and its translation into health improvements is receiving growing attention. Reducing time lags should increase rates of return to such research. However, ways to measure time lags are under-developed, with little attention on where time lags arise within overall timelines. The process marker model has been proposed as a better way forward than the current focus on an increasingly complex series of translation 'gaps'. Starting from that model, we aimed to develop better methods to measure and understand time lags and develop ways to identify policy options and produce recommendations for future studies. METHODS: Following reviews of the literature on time lags and of relevant policy documents, we developed a new approach to conduct case studies of time lags. We built on the process marker model, including developing a matrix with a series of overlapping tracks to allow us to present and measure elements within any overall time lag. We identified a reduced number of key markers or calibration points and tested our new approach in seven case studies of research leading to interventions in cardiovascular disease and mental health. Finally, we analysed the data to address our study's key aims. RESULTS: The literature review illustrated the lack of agreement on starting points for measuring time lags. We mapped points from policy documents onto our matrix and thus highlighted key areas of concern, for example around delays before new therapies become widely available. Our seven completed case studies demonstrate we have made considerable progress in developing methods to measure and understand time lags. The matrix of overlapping tracks of activity in the research and implementation processes facilitated analysis of time lags along each track, and at the cross-over points where the next track started. We identified some factors that speed up translation through the actions of companies, researchers, funders, policymakers, and regulators. Recommendations for further work are built on progress made, limitations identified and revised terminology. CONCLUSIONS: Our advances identify complexities, provide a firm basis for further methodological work along and between tracks, and begin to indicate potential ways of reducing lags.},

METHODS: By using Danish nationwide medical databases, we identified all cancer patients with a prior hospital-based HZ diagnosis during 1982-2011 (n=2754) and a matched cancer cohort without prior HZ (n=26 243). We computed adjusted mortality rate ratios (aMRRs) associating prior HZ with mortality following cancer. RESULTS: Prior HZ was associated with decreased mortality within the year after cancer diagnosis (aMRR 0.87; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.81-0.93), but not thereafter (aMRR 1.07; 95\% CI: 0.99-1.15). However, prior HZ predicted increased mortality throughout the entire follow-up among patients aged {\textless}60 years (aMRR 1.39; 95\% CI: 1.15-1.68) and those with disseminated HZ (aMRR 1.18; 95\% CI: 1.01-1.37). The increased mortality rates were observed primarily for haematological and immune-related cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, HZ was not a predictor of increased mortality following subsequent cancer.},

We used sibling comparisons to examine the nature of this association and to investigate if this association is explained by early environment or genetic and socioeconomic factors. Methods: A large population-based cohort including all singletons born in Denmark from 1 January 1991 through 31 December 2005 was followed from birth until 30 April 2011. Data were available for 94\% ( N = 943 785) of the population. Offspring ADHD was identified by an ICD-10 diagnosis of Hyperkinetic Disorder (HKD). We used sibling-matched Cox regression to control for genetic and socioeconomic factors. Results: In the population cohort we found that children born by parents aged 20 years or younger had more than twice the risk of being diagnosed with ADHD compared with children with parents between 26 and 30 years of age. When comparing full siblings the associations were attenuated, but we found a trend of increased risk of ADHD with decreasing maternal age, which was not seen for paternal age. Conclusions: Sibling comparisons suggested that the associations between both maternal and paternal age and ADHD are partly explained by common genetic and socioeconomic factors. The trend of increased risk of ADHD with decreasing maternal age, but not with paternal age, may be linked to pregnancy or early-life environmental factors. Even though only a smaller part of the association can be attributed to environmental factors, there is a public health interest to support young parents through their first years of parenthood.},

	doi = {10.1093/ije/dyy103},
	abstract = {Background: To assess the extent to which multiple gestations mediate risk of pregnancy complications from fertility treatment and to address possible confounding by the underlying infertility. Methods: From the nearly 1.8 million pregnancies recorded in the Swedish Medical Birth Register between 1996 and 2013, we selected the 9.9\% (N = 174 067) that occurred to couples with known trouble conceiving (clinical infertility). Fertility treatment was identified from self-reports, medical records and procedural information from fertility clinics. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and their 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), and decomposed the total effect into direct and mediated effects to estimate the proportion mediated by multiple gestations. Results: Compared with pregnancies achieved without any assistance, those having received some treatment had higher odds of all studied complications except gestational diabetes. Associations with placenta previa (OR 2.17, 95\% CI 1.95-2.40) and placental abruption (OR 1.77, 95\% CI 1.54-2.03) were almost entirely independent of multiple gestations. In contrast, the majority of the associations with preterm birth (OR 1.69, 95\% CI 1.62-1.77), caesarean delivery (RR 1.15, 95\% CI 1.13-1.17) and pre-eclampsia (OR 1.17, 95\% CI 1.11-1.22) were mediated by multiple gestations (87\%, 62\% and 91\% of the effect mediated, respectively). Both direct and mediated pathways contributed to the remaining positive associations with chorioamnionitis, labour induction and postpartum haemorrhage. Results were similar when considering primi- and multi-parous women separately, and after restriction to assisted reproductive technologies only. Conclusion: Multiple gestations are responsible for a large proportion of pregnancy complications associated with fertility treatment, suggesting that interventions to restrict the occurrence of multiples could reduce excess risk of pre-eclampsia, preterm birth and caesarean delivery after fertility treatment. However, the elevated risk of serious placental complications after fertility treatment appears to be largely independent of multiple gestations.},

Using a previously published cohort study of postmyocardial infarction statin use (1998-2012), we compare the performance of the algorithm with a number of popular machine learning approaches for confounder selection in high-dimensional covariate spaces: random forest, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and elastic net. Our results suggest that, when the data analysis is done with epidemiologic principles in mind, machine learning methods perform as well as the high-dimensional propensity score algorithm. Using a plasmode framework that mimicked the empirical data, we also showed that a hybrid of machine learning and high-dimensional propensity score algorithms generally perform slightly better than both in terms of mean squared error, when a bias-based analysis is used.},

This study examined the risk of developing cancer (i.e. SIR) that occurs in association with CD. METHODS: The subjects were 770 CD patients managed at our hospital department, which specializes in inflammatory bowel disease, during the approximately 25 years from July 1985 to August 2010. The number of expected cancer patients in a healthy population matched for sex and age with the CD patients in our hospital was then calculated. The relative risk, or SIR, was also calculated. RESULTS: The total observation period was 10,552 person-years, during which 19 cases (2.5\%) of cancer were discovered in 770 subjects. The cancer cases included nine cases of colorectal cancer (CRC), one case of small bowel cancer, one case of stomach cancer, three cases of acute myeloid leukemia, two cases of endometrial cancer, one case of lung cancer, one case of skin cancer, and one case of thyroid cancer. The SIR for cancers in Japan in 2003 was 0.87 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.52-1.35) for all cancers, 2.79 (95\% CI 1.28-5.29) for CRC, and 6.94 (95\% CI 1.43-20.3) for leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Among the cancers in CD patients in our hospital, no significant difference was seen in the risk for all cancers in comparison with the standard population. However, the risks for CRC and leukemia were significantly higher than in the standard population.},

	abstract = {Almost all previous studies of familial risk of epilepsy have had potentially serious methodological limitations. Our goal was to address these limitations and provide more rigorous estimates of familial risk in a population-based study. We used the unique resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project to identify all 660 Rochester, Minnesota residents born in 1920 or later with incidence of epilepsy from 1935-94 (probands) and their 2439 first-degree relatives who resided in Olmsted County. We assessed incidence of epilepsy in relatives by comprehensive review of the relatives' medical records, and estimated age-specific cumulative incidence and standardized incidence ratios for epilepsy in relatives compared with the general population, according to proband and relative characteristics. Among relatives of all probands, cumulative incidence of epilepsy to age 40 was 4.7\%, and risk was increased 3.3-fold (95\% confidence interval 2.75-5.99) compared with population incidence. Risk was increased to the greatest extent in relatives of probands with idiopathic generalized epilepsies (standardized incidence ratio 6.0) and epilepsies associated with intellectual or motor disability presumed present from birth, which we denoted 'prenatal/developmental cause' (standardized incidence ratio 4.3). Among relatives of probands with epilepsy without identified cause (including epilepsies classified as 'idiopathic' or 'unknown cause'), risk was significantly increased for epilepsy of prenatal/developmental cause (standardized incidence ratio 4.1). Similarly, among relatives of probands with prenatal/developmental cause, risk was significantly increased for epilepsies without identified cause (standardized incidence ratio 3.8). In relatives of probands with generalized epilepsy, standardized incidence ratios were 8.3 (95\% confidence interval 2.93-15.31) for generalized epilepsy and 2.5 (95\% confidence interval 0.92-4.00) for focal epilepsy. In relatives of probands with focal epilepsy, standardized incidence ratios were 1.0 (95\% confidence interval 0.00-2.19) for generalized epilepsy and 2.6 (95\% confidence interval 1.19-4.26) for focal epilepsy. Epilepsy incidence was greater in offspring of female probands than in offspring of male probands, and this maternal effect was restricted to offspring of probands with focal epilepsy. The results suggest that risks for epilepsies of unknown and prenatal/developmental cause may be influenced by shared genetic mechanisms. They also suggest that some of the genetic influences on generalized and focal epilepsies are distinct. However, the similar increase in risk for focal epilepsy among relatives of probands with either generalized (2.5-fold) or focal epilepsy (2.6-fold) may reflect some coexisting shared genetic influences.},

A new exact method presented here uses this property to improve the efficiency of computations. The new method is generally faster than a method previously described.

SDP was associated with all outcomes. Within-family analyses of the pregnancy outcomes were consistent with a causal interpretation as the associations persisted when siblings discordant for SDP were compared. For the cognitive and externalizing outcomes, the results were not consistent with causal effects; when comparing differentially exposed siblings none of the associations remained significant. In quantitative genetic models genetic factors explained the majority of the associations between SDP and cognitive and externalizing outcomes. The results suggest that the associations between SDP in mothers and cognition and externalizing behaviors in their offspring is primarily due to genetic effects that influence the behaviors in both generations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A standard parameter to compare the disease incidence of a cohort relative to the population is the standardized incidence ratio (SIR). For statistical inference is commonly assumed that the denominator, the expected number of cases, is fixed. If a disease registry is available, incident cases can sometimes be identified by linkage with the registry, however, registries may not contain information on migration or death from other causes. A complete follow-up with a population registry may not be possible. In that case, end-of-follow-up date and therefore, exact person-years of observation are unknown. METHODS: We have developed a method to estimate the observation times and to derive the expected number of cases using population data on mortality and migration rates. We investigate the impact of the underlying assumptions with a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The method provides a useful estimate of the SIR. We illustrate the method with a numerical example, a simulation study and with a study on standardized cancer incidence ratios in a cohort of migrants relative to the German population. We show that the additional variance induced by the estimation method is small, so that standard methods for inference can be applied.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Women who give birth at younger ages (e.g. teenage mothers) are more likely to have children who exhibit behaviour problems, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, it is not clear whether young maternal age is causally associated with poor offspring outcomes or confounded by familial factors. METHODS: The association between early maternal age at childbirth and offspring ADHD was studied using data from Swedish national registers. The sample included all children born in Sweden between 1988 and 2003 (N = 1 495 543), including 30 674 children with ADHD. We used sibling- and cousin-comparisons to control for unmeasured genetic and environmental confounding. Further, we used a children-of-siblings model to quantify the genetic and environmental contribution to the association between maternal age and offspring ADHD. RESULTS: Maternal age at first birth (MAFB) was associated with offspring ADHD. Teenage childbirth ({\textless}20 years) was associated with 78\% increased risk of ADHD. The association attenuated in cousin-comparison, suggesting unmeasured familial confounding. The children-of-siblings model indicated that the association between MAFB and ADHD was mainly explained by genetic confounding. CONCLUSIONS: All children born to mothers who bore their first child early in their reproductive lives were at increased risk of ADHD. The association was mainly explained by genetic factors transmitted from mothers to their offspring that contribute to both age at childbirth and ADHD in offspring. Our results highlight the importance of using family-based designs to understand how early life circumstances affect child development.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maternal cigarette smoking is a suspected cause of oral clefts, although this association has not been firmly established. We used case-crossover, case-time-control, and bidirectional case-crossover designs to supplement findings from a case-control study of maternal smoking and oral clefts among offspring in a large birth registry. METHODS: Data are from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry. From 1983 through 1997 there were 678 recorded cases of cleft palate and 1175 cases of cleft lip with or without palate. Maternal smoking status was ascertained in early pregnancy. Controls for the case-control study were a random sample of infants born without a cleft; controls for the case-crossover designs were nonmalformed infants born to case mothers. RESULTS: Cleft palate was positively associated with maternal smoking in all study designs, whereas cleft lip with or without cleft palate was associated with smoking only in the case-control design. In the case-control design, the odds ratios for cleft palate were 1.2 (95\% confidence interval = 1.0-1.5) for women who smoked 1 to 9 cigarettes per day and 1.4 (1.1-1.8) for women who smoked 10+ cigarettes per day. In the case-time-control analysis, the odds ratio for cleft palate with maternal smoking was 3.2 (1.3-7.4) and in the bidirectional case-crossover design, the odds ratio was 2.2 (1.1-4.1). CONCLUSIONS: An association between smoking and cleft palate was supported by all designs, whereas that between smoking and cleft lip with or without cleft palate was not. Case-only designs are a viable option in birth registries and may yield more information than a case-control design alone.},

	abstract = {The Missouri Mothers and Their Children Study (MO-MATCH) was specifically designed to critically investigate prenatal environmental influences on child attention problems and associated learning and cognitive deficits. The project began as a pilot study in 2004 and was formally launched in 2008. Participants in the study were initially identified via the Department of Vital Statistics birth record (BR) database. Interview and lab-based data were obtained from: (1) mothers of Missouri-born children (born 1998-2005), who smoked during one pregnancy but not during another pregnancy; (2) biological fathers when available; and (3) the children (i.e., full sibling pairs discordant for exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy (SDP). This within-mother, between-pregnancy contrast provides the best possible methodological control for many stable maternal and familial confounding factors (e.g., heritable and socio-demographic characteristics of the mother that predict increased probability of SDP). It also controls for differences between mothers who do and do not smoke during pregnancy, and their partners, that might otherwise artifactually create, or alternatively mask, associations between SDP and child outcomes. Such a design will therefore provide opportunities to determine less biased effect sizes while also allowing us to investigate (on a preliminary basis) the possible contribution of paternal or other second-hand smoke exposure during the pre, peri, and postnatal periods to offspring outcome. This protocol has developed a cohort that can be followed longitudinally through periods typically associated with increased externalizing symptoms and substance used initiation.},

The children were followed for a maximum of 16.5 years and contributed 8.1x10(6) person years at risk.Exposures for observational studies Children were categorised into four groups according to maternal antidepressant use within two years before and during pregnancy: unexposed, antidepressant discontinuation (use before but not during pregnancy), antidepressant continuation (use both before and during pregnancy), and new user (use only during pregnancy).Main outcome measure First psychiatric diagnosis in children, defined as first day of inpatient or outpatient treatment for psychiatric disorders. Hazard ratios of psychiatric disorders were estimated using Cox regression models.Results Overall, psychiatric disorders were diagnosed in 32 400 children. The adjusted 15 year cumulative incidence of psychiatric disorders was 8.0\% (95\% confidence interval 7.9\% to 8.2\%) in the unexposed group, 11.5\% (10.3\% to 12.9\%) in the antidepressant discontinuation group, 13.6\% (11.3\% to 16.3\%) in the continuation group, and 14.5\% (10.5\% to 19.8\%) in the new user group. The antidepressant continuation group had an increased risk of psychiatric disorders (hazard ratio 1.27, 1.17 to 1.38), compared with the discontinuation group.Conclusions In utero exposure to antidepressants was associated with increased risk of psychiatric disorders. The association may be attributable to the severity of underlying maternal disorders in combination with antidepressant exposure in utero. The findings suggest that focusing solely on a single psychiatric disorder among offspring in studies of in utero antidepressant exposure may be too restrictive.},

Several studies have shown lower premorbid intelligence in individuals before the onset of both mood disorders and psychosis, as well as in children and adolescents at genetic high risk for developing schizophrenia. Based on these findings, we aim to investigate if the association between educational achievement in parents and intelligence in their offspring is influenced by schizophrenia or mood disorder in parents. In a large population-based sample of young adult male conscripts (n = 156,531) the presence of a mental disorder in the parents were associated with significantly lower offspring scores on a test of general intelligence, the Borge Priens Prove (BPP), and higher educational attainment in parents was significantly associated with higher BPP test scores in offspring. A significant interaction suggested that the positive association between maternal education and offspring intelligence was stronger in offspring of mothers with schizophrenia compared to the control group (p = 0.03). The associations between parental education and offspring intelligence are also observed when restricting the sample to conscripts whose parents are diagnosed after 30 years of age. In conclusion, findings from this study show a more positive effect of education on offspring intelligence in mothers with schizophrenia compared to mothers from the control group. This effect could have both environmental and genetic explanations.},

These designs have the advantage that they avoid the problem of population stratification that can lead to spurious associations with noncausal genes. We focus on designs that use sibling, cousin, or pseudosibling controls, the latter formed as the set of genotypes not transmitted to the case from his or her parents. We describe a common conditional likelihood framework for use in analyzing data from any of these designs and review what is known about the validity of the various design and analysis combinations for estimating the genetic relative risk. We also present comparisons of efficiency for each of the family-based designs relative to the standard population-control design in which unrelated controls are selected from the source population of cases. Because of overmatching on genotype, the use of sibling controls leads to estimates of genetic relative risk that are approximately half as efficient as those obtained with the use of population controls, while relative efficiency for cousin controls is approximately 90\%. However, we find that, for a rare gene, the sibling-control design can lead to improved efficiency for estimating a G x E interaction effect. We also review some restricted designs that can substantially improve efficiency, e.g., restriction of the sample to case-sibling pairs with an affected parent. We conclude that family-based case-control studies are an attractive alternative to population-based case-control designs using unrelated control subjects.},

	abstract = {Background Observational cohort studies and a secondary prevention trial have shown inverse associations between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cardiovascular risk. Methods In a multicenter trial in Spain, we assigned 7447 participants (55 to 80 years of age, 57\% women) who were at high cardiovascular risk, but with no cardiovascular disease at enrollment, to one of three diets: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts, or a control diet (advice to reduce dietary fat). Participants received quarterly educational sessions and, depending on group assignment, free provision of extra-virgin olive oil, mixed nuts, or small nonfood gifts. The primary end point was a major cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes). After a median follow-up of 4.8 years, the trial was stopped on the basis of a prespecified interim analysis. In 2013, we reported the results for the primary end point in the Journal. We subsequently identified protocol deviations, including enrollment of household members without randomization, assignment to a study group without randomization of some participants at 1 of 11 study sites, and apparent inconsistent use of randomization tables at another site. We have withdrawn our previously published report and now report revised effect estimates based on analyses that do not rely exclusively on the assumption that all the participants were randomly assigned. Results A primary end-point event occurred in 288 participants; there were 96 events in the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil (3.8\%), 83 in the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with nuts (3.4\%), and 109 in the control group (4.4\%). In the intention-to-treat analysis including all the participants and adjusting for baseline characteristics and propensity scores, the hazard ratio was 0.69 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.53 to 0.91) for a Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil and 0.72 (95\% CI, 0.54 to 0.95) for a Mediterranean diet with nuts, as compared with the control diet. Results were similar after the omission of 1588 participants whose study-group assignments were known or suspected to have departed from the protocol. Conclusions In this study involving persons at high cardiovascular risk, the incidence of major cardiovascular events was lower among those assigned to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts than among those assigned to a reduced-fat diet.

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether pertussis is associated with the long-term risk of epilepsy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used individually linked data from population-based medical registries covering all Danish hospitals to identify a cohort of all patients with pertussis born between 1978 and 2011, followed up through 2011. We used the Civil Registration System to identify 10 individuals from the general population for each patient with pertussis, matched on sex and year of birth. EXPOSURES: Inpatient or hospital-based outpatient diagnosis of pertussis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cumulative incidence and hazard ratio of time to hospital-based epilepsy diagnosis (pertussis cohort vs general population cohort), adjusted for birth year, sex, maternal history of epilepsy, presence of congenital malformations, and gestational age. Unique personal identifiers permitted unambiguous data linkage and complete follow-up for death, emigration, and hospital contacts. RESULTS: We identified 4700 patients with pertussis (48\% male), of whom 90 developed epilepsy during the follow-up. The cumulative incidence of epilepsy at age 10 years was 1.7\% (95\% CI, 1.4\%-2.1\%) for patients with pertussis and 0.9\% (95\% CI, 0.8\%-1.0\%) for the matched comparison cohort. The corresponding adjusted overall hazard ratio was 1.7 (95\% CI, 1.3-2.1).

	abstract = {AIM: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) has long been regarded as a marker of underlying malignancy in the general population. Patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of developing VTE, but it is unclear whether VTE in diabetes patients is also a harbinger of occult cancer. METHODS: From Danish medical health databases, we identified all diabetes patients (N=8783) with a first-time diagnosis of VTE during 1978-2011. We followed the patients until a first-time diagnosis of cancer, emigration, death, or study end, whichever came first. We calculated one-year absolute cancer risk and overall and site-specific standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for cancer based on national cancer incidence. RESULTS: During the total study period 878 cancers were observed. The one-year absolute cancer risk was 4.1\% and the corresponding SIR was 3.28 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2.94-3.64). The highest SIRs were observed for cancers of the gallbladder and biliary tract (SIR 13.59; 6.77-24.31), the pancreas (SIR 10.16; 6.85-14.50), the ovary (SIR 9.85; 5.63-16.00), and the liver (SIR 9.39; 4.30-17.84). After the first year of follow-up, the overall cancer SIR associated with VTE and diabetes decreased to 1.05 (95\% CI: 0.97-1.15). CONCLUSIONS: VTE may be a marker of underlying cancer in patients with diabetes mellitus.},

Although the randomized experiment is widely considered the gold standard for determining whether a given exposure increases the likelihood of some specified outcome, experiments are not always feasible and in some cases can result in biased estimates of causal effects. Alternatively, standard observational approaches are limited by the possibility of confounding, reverse causation, and the nonrandom distribution of exposure (i.e., selection). We describe the counterfactual model of causation and apply it to the challenges of causal inference in observational research, with a particular focus on aging. We argue that the study of twin pairs discordant on exposure, and in particular discordant monozygotic twins, provides a useful analog to the idealized counterfactual design. A review of discordant-twin studies in aging reveals that they are consistent with, but do not unambiguously establish, a causal effect of lifestyle factors on important late-life outcomes. Nonetheless, the existing studies are few in number and have clear limitations that have not always been considered in interpreting their results. It is concluded that twin researchers could make greater use of the discordant-twin design as one approach to strengthen causal inferences in observational research.},

	abstract = {Amphetamine (AMP), an indirectly acting psychostimulant approved for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children, adolescents, and adults, is among the most long-standing therapeutic agents in all of clinical psychopharmacology. This review focuses on AMP absorption, metabolism, and elimination brought to bear on comparative pharmacokinetics in its various formulations. A comprehensive search of the published literature was conducted using MEDLINE (PubMed) and Google Scholar databases through April 2017 to retrieve all pertinent in vitro and human studies for review and synthesis. Additionally, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) databases were accessed for otherwise unavailable data when possible. Initially available as racemic (dl)-AMP, this drug was later supplanted by enantiopure (d)-AMPH or enantioenriched (75:25 dl)-AMP formulations; although racemic AMP returned as an approved drug to treat ADHD in 2014. Presently, there are several immediate-release (IR) formulations available, including d-AMP, dl-AMP, and mixed amphetamine salts, which are neither racemic nor the pure d-enantiomer (i.e., a 3:1 mixture of d-AMP and l-AMP). Furthermore, new modified-release AMP formulations, including an oral suspension and an orally disintegrating tablet, are now available. A lysine-bonded prodrug form of d-AMP also serves as a treatment option. Oral AMP is rapidly absorbed, with high absolute bioavailability, followed by extensive metabolism involving multiple enzymes. Some metabolic pathways exhibit stereoselective biotransformations favoring the l-isomer substrate. Drug exposure exhibits dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. Body weight is a fundamental determinant of differences in observed AMP plasma concentrations. IR formulations typically provide a Tmax from 2 to 3 hours. In replicated studies, children exhibit a shorter plasma T1/2 ( approximately 7 hours) relative to adults ( approximately 10 to 12 hours). There are few documented pharmacokinetic drug interactions of clinical significance beyond influences of drug-induced alteration of urinary pH. The array of AMP formulations addressed in this review offer flexibility in dosing, drug onset, and offset to assist in individualized pharmacotherapy of ADHD.},

In particular, the manuscript details how combining the use of measured covariates with sibling-comparisons, cousin-comparisons, and additional designs can help elucidate the sources of covariation between early-life exposures and later outcomes, including the roles of (a) factors that are not shared in families, including a potential causal effect of the exposure; (b) carryover effects from the exposure of one child to the next; and (c) familial confounding. We also describe key assumptions and how they can be critically evaluated.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the variability in outcomes of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at age 2. Research is needed to understand the children whose symptoms - or diagnoses - change over time. The objectives of this study were to examine the behavioral and diagnostic outcomes of a carefully defined sample of 2-year-old children with ASD, and to identify child and environmental factors that contribute to variability in outcomes at age 4. METHODS: Forty-eight children diagnosed with autism or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDDNOS) at age 2 were followed to age 4. Diagnostic measures included the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule - Generic (ADOS-G) and clinical diagnosis at ages 2 and 4, and the ADI-R at age 4. RESULTS: Diagnostic stability for an ASD diagnosis (autism or PDDNOS) was 63\%, and for an autism diagnosis was 68\%. Children who failed to meet diagnostic criteria for ASD at follow-up were more likely to: 1) be 30 months or younger at initial evaluation; 2) have milder symptoms of autism, particularly in the social domain; and 3) have higher cognitive scores at age 2. No differences between children with stable and unstable diagnoses were found for amount of intervention services received. Among the children with unstable diagnoses, all but one continued to have developmental disorders, most commonly in the area of language. CONCLUSIONS: The stability of ASD was lower in the present study than has been reported previously, a finding largely attributable to children who were diagnosed at 30 months or younger. Implications for clinical practice are discussed.},

Objective: To evaluate alternative hypotheses for associations between first-trimester antidepressant exposure and birth and neurodevelopmental problems. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study included Swedish offspring born between 1996 and 2012 and followed up through 2013 or censored by death or emigration. Analyses controlling for pregnancy, maternal and paternal covariates, as well as sibling comparisons, timing of exposure comparisons, and paternal comparisons, were used to examine the associations. Exposures: Maternal self-reported first-trimester antidepressant use and first-trimester antidepressant dispensations. Main Outcomes and Measures: Preterm birth ({\textless}37 gestational weeks), small for gestational age (birth weight {\textless}2 SDs below the mean for gestational age), and first inpatient or outpatient clinical diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in offspring. Results: Among 1580629 offspring (mean gestational age, 279 days; 48.6\% female; 1.4\% [n = 22544] with maternal first-trimester self-reported antidepressant use) born to 943776 mothers (mean age at childbirth, 30 years), 6.98\% of exposed vs 4.78\% of unexposed offspring were preterm, 2.54\% of exposed vs 2.19\% of unexposed were small for gestational age, 5.28\% of exposed vs 2.14\% of unexposed were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder by age 15 years, and 12.63\% of exposed vs 5.46\% of unexposed were diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder by age 15 years. At the population level, first-trimester exposure was associated with all outcomes compared with unexposed offspring (preterm birth odds ratio [OR], 1.47 [95\% CI, 1.40-1.55]; small for gestational age OR, 1.15 [95\% CI, 1.06-1.25]; autism spectrum disorder hazard ratio [HR], 2.02 [95\% CI, 1.80-2.26]; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder HR, 2.21 [95\% CI, 2.04-2.39]). However, in models that compared siblings while adjusting for pregnancy, maternal, and paternal traits, first-trimester antidepressant exposure was associated with preterm birth (OR, 1.34 [95\% CI, 1.18-1.52]) but not with small for gestational age (OR, 1.01 [95\% CI, 0.81-1.25]), autism spectrum disorder (HR, 0.83 [95\% CI, 0.62-1.13]), or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (HR, 0.99 [95\% CI, 0.79-1.25]). Results from analyses assessing associations with maternal dispensations before pregnancy and with paternal first-trimester dispensations were consistent with findings from the sibling comparisons. Conclusions and Relevance: Among offspring born in Sweden, after accounting for confounding factors, first-trimester exposure to antidepressants, compared with no exposure, was associated with a small increased risk of preterm birth but no increased risk of small for gestational age, autism spectrum disorder, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.},

	abstract = {In this MiniReview, we provide general considerations for the planning and conduct of pharmacoepidemiological studies of associations between drug use and cancer development. We address data sources, study design, assessment of drug exposure, ascertainment of cancer outcomes, confounder adjustment and future perspectives. Aspects of data sources include assessment of complete history of drug use and data on dose and duration of drug use, allowing estimates of cumulative exposure. Outcome data from formal cancer registries are preferable, but cancer data from other sources, for example, patient or pathology registries, medical records or claims are also suitable. The two principal designs for observational studies evaluating drug-cancer associations are the cohort and case-control designs. A key challenge in studies of drug-cancer associations is the exposure assessment due to the typically long period of cancer development. We present methods to examine early and late effects of drug use on cancer development and discuss the need for employing 'lag-time' in order to avoid reverse causation. We emphasize that a new-user study design should always be considered. We also underline the need for 'dose-response' analyses, as drug-cancer associations are likely to be dose-dependent. Generally, studies of drug-cancer associations should explore risk of site-specific cancer, rather than cancer overall. Additional differentiation may also be crucial for organ-specific cancer with various distinct histological subtypes (e.g., lung or ovary cancer). We also highlight the influence of confounding factors and discuss various methods to address confounding, while emphasizing that the choices of methods depend on the design and specific objectives of the individual study. In some studies, use of active comparator(s) may be preferable. Pharmacoepidemiological studies of drug-cancer associations are expected to evolve considerably in the coming years, due to the increasing availability of long-term data on drug exposures and cancer outcomes, the increasing conduct of multinational studies, allowing studies of rare cancers and subtypes of cancer, and methodological improvements specifically addressing cancer and other long-term outcomes.},

Objective: To examine overall mortality, colorectal cancer-specific mortality, and colorectal cancer-specific recurrence rates among patients with stage II or III colorectal cancer who were randomized after curative surgery to 2 alternative schedules for follow-up testing with computed tomography and carcinoembryonic antigen. Design, Setting, and Participants: Unblinded randomized trial including 2509 patients with stage II or III colorectal cancer treated at 24 centers in Sweden, Denmark, and Uruguay from January 2006 through December 2010 and followed up for 5 years; follow-up ended on December 31, 2015. Interventions: Patients were randomized either to follow-up testing with computed tomography of the thorax and abdomen and serum carcinoembryonic antigen at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months after surgery (high-frequency group; n = 1253 patients) or at 12 and 36 months after surgery (low-frequency group; n = 1256 patients). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were 5-year overall mortality and colorectal cancer-specific mortality rates. The secondary outcome was the colorectal cancer-specific recurrence rate. Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed. Results: Among 2555 patients who were randomized, 2509 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (mean age, 63.5 years; 1128 women [45\%]) and 2365 (94.3\%) completed the trial. The 5-year overall patient mortality rate in the high-frequency group was 13.0\% (161/1253) compared with 14.1\% (174/1256) in the low-frequency group (risk difference, 1.1\% [95\% CI, -1.6\% to 3.8\%]; P = .43). The 5-year colorectal cancer-specific mortality rate in the high-frequency group was 10.6\% (128/1248) compared with 11.4\% (137/1250) in the low-frequency group (risk difference, 0.8\% [95\% CI, -1.7\% to 3.3\%]; P = .52).

Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with stage II or III colorectal cancer, follow-up testing with computed tomography and carcinoembryonic antigen more frequently compared with less frequently did not result in a significant rate reduction in 5-year overall mortality or colorectal cancer-specific mortality.

We conducted a matched case-control study nested within the total population of Sweden (children aged 4-17 who were born in Sweden from 1984 to 2007). The sample consisted of 23 748 ASD cases and 208 796 controls, matched by birth month and year, sex and region of birth. PCOS and ASD were defined from ICD codes through linkage to health-care registers. Maternal PCOS increased the odds of ASD in the offspring by 59\%, after adjustment for confounders (odds ratio (OR) 1.59, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.34-1.88). The odds of offspring ASD were further increased among mothers with both PCOS and obesity, a condition common to PCOS that is related to more severe hyperandrogenemia (OR 2.13, 95\% CI 1.46-3.10). Risk estimates did not differ between sexes. In conclusion, children of women with PCOS appear to have a higher risk of developing ASD. This finding awaits confirmation, and exploration of potentially underlying mechanisms, including the role of sex steroids in the etiology of ASD.},

Propensity score has been a key component in this research area. However, propensity score based matching methods in the literature have several limitations, such as model mis-specifications, categorical variables with more than two levels, difficulties in handling missing data, and nonlinear relationships. Random forest, averaging outcomes from many decision trees, is nonparametric in nature, straightforward to use, and capable of solving these issues. More importantly, the precision afforded by random forest (Caruana et al., 2008) may provide us with a more accurate and less model dependent estimate of the propensity score. In addition, the proximity matrix, a by-product of the random forest, may naturally serve as a distance measure between observations that can be used in matching. The proposed random forest based matching methods are applied to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Our results show that the proposed methods can produce well balanced treatment and control groups. An illustration is also provided that the methods can effectively deal with missing data in covariates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postmarketing observational studies of the safety and effectiveness of prescription medications are critically important but fraught with methodological problems. The data sources available for such research often lack information on indications and other important confounders for the drug exposure under study. Instrumental variable methods have been proposed as a potential approach to control confounding by indication in nonexperimental studies of treatment effects; however, good instruments are hard to find. METHODS: We propose an instrument for use in pharmacoepidemiology that is based on a time-varying estimate of the prescribing physician's preference for one drug relative to a competing therapy. The use of this instrument is illustrated in a study comparing the effect of exposure to COX-2 inhibitors with nonselective, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications on gastrointestinal complications. RESULTS: Using conventional multivariable regression adjusting for 17 potential confounders, we found no protective effect due to COX-2 use within 120 days from the initial exposure (risk difference = -0.06 per 100 patients; 95\% confidence interval = -0.26 to 0.14). However, the proposed instrumental variable method attributed a protective effect to COX-2 exposure (-1.31 per 100 patients; -2.42 to -0.20) compatible with randomized trial results (-0.65 per 100 patients; -1.08 to -0.22). CONCLUSIONS: The instrumental variable method that we have proposed appears to have substantially reduced the bias due to unobserved confounding. However, more work needs to be done to understand the sensitivity of this approach to possible violations of the instrumental variable assumptions.},

This bias results from the use of time-windows of different lengths between cases and controls to define time-dependent exposures. We illustrate the bias using a population of 365,467 patients from the United Kingdom's General Practice Research Database, including 1786 incident cases of lung cancer during 1998-2004. The case-control approach used in the published study yielded a rate ratio of lung cancer incidence of 0.62 with statin use (95\% confidence interval = 0.55-0.71). A case-control approach that properly accounts for time produces a rate ratio of 0.99 (0.85-1.16)-suggesting no benefit of statins on lung cancer risk. We show analytically that the magnitude of the bias is proportional to the ratio of the unequal time-window lengths.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Time-related biases in observational studies of drug effects have been described extensively in different therapeutic areas but less so in diabetes. Immortal time bias, time-window bias, and time-lag bias all tend to greatly exaggerate the benefits observed with a drug. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: These time-related biases are described and shown to be prominent in observational studies that have associated metformin with impressive reductions in the incidence of and mortality from cancer. As a consequence, metformin received much attention as a potential anticancer agent; these observational studies sparked the conduction of randomized, controlled trials of metformin as cancer treatment. However, the spectacular effects reported in these studies are compatible with time-related biases. RESULTS: We found that 13 observational studies suffered from immortal time bias; 9 studies had not considered time-window bias, whereas other studies did not consider inherent time-lagging issues when comparing the first-line treatment metformin with second- or third-line treatments. These studies, subject to time-related biases that are avoidable with proper study design and data analysis, led to illusory extraordinarily significant effects, with reductions in cancer risk with metformin ranging from 20 to 94\%. Three studies that avoided these biases reported no effect of metformin use on cancer incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Although observational studies are important to better understand the effects of drugs, their proper design and analysis is essential to avoid major time-related biases. With respect to metformin, the scientific evidence of its potential beneficial effects on cancer would need to be reassessed critically before embarking on further long and expensive trials.},

Standardization has been recognized as a method to control confounding and to estimate causal parameters of interest. Because standardization requires stratification by confounders, the sparse-data problem will occur when stratified by many confounders and one then might have an unstable estimator. A new class of causal models called marginal structural models has recently been proposed. In marginal structural models, the parameters are consistently estimated by the inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting method. Marginal structural models give a nonparametric standardization using the total group (exposed and unexposed) as the standard. In epidemiologic analysis, it is also important to know the change in the average risk of the exposed (or the unexposed) subgroup produced by exposure, which corresponds to the exposed (or the unexposed) group as the standard. We propose modifications of the weights in the marginal structural models, which give the nonparametric estimation of standardized parameters. With the proposed weights, we can use the marginal structural models as a useful tool for the nonparametric multivariate standardization.},

This study aimed to examine the relative risk of breast cancer for older women initiating metformin versus sulfonylureas while avoiding such biases. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of women aged 65+ who initiated monotherapy with metformin (n = 45,900) or sulfonylureas (n = 13,904) and were free of cancer and renal disease within 6 months before treatment initiation using 2007-2012 US Medicare claims data. We followed treatment initiators for incident breast cancer, and estimated hazard ratios using weighted Cox models. Unmeasured confounding by body mass index and smoking was further adjusted by propensity score calibration using external information from Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey 2006-2009 panels. RESULTS: During 58,835 and 16,366 person-years of follow-up, 385 initiators of metformin treatment and 95 of sulfonylurea were diagnosed with breast cancer. Metformin initiators did not have a reduced risk of breast cancer compared with sulfonylurea initiators (hazard ratio: 1.2; 95\% confidence interval: 0.94, 1.6). Externally controlling for body mass index and smoking did not affect the estimates. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study provide no support for a reduced risk of breast cancer after initiation of metformin compared with a clinical alternative in older women. This study is limited by the relatively short follow-up time and we cannot exclude the possible benefits of long-time metformin use on breast cancer risk.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to characterize the utilization of medication against attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in Denmark between 1995 and 2011 from a national perspective, by using population-based prescription data. METHODS: National data on drug use in Denmark between 1 January 1995 and 30 September 2011 were extracted from the Registry of Medicinal Product Statistics (RMPS). Drug utilization was characterized using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 1,085,090 prescriptions issued to 54,020 persons were identified. The incidence rate was stable in the last 3 years of the study period, and a slightly decreasing incidence rate and a stabilizing prevalence were observed towards the end of this period. The therapeutic intensity was 6.7 defined daily dose/person/day, with large regional differences that ranged from 64 to 145 \% of the national average. Methylphenidate accounted for 92.6 \% of DDDs used. The general practitioner (GP) rarely initiated treatment, although treatment initiation based on the GP's advice increased with older age of the patient. Maintenance treatment was found to be distributed roughly equally between prescriber types. For methylphenidate, 1 \% of users accounted for 6.1 \% of the drug volume and 50 \% of users accounted for 84.4 \%. The data therefore do not suggest a high proportion of heavy users. CONCLUSION: The findings of this analysis are mostly reassuring, with the data indicating a seemingly stagnant incidence and prevalence rate and lacking evidence of heavy users. However, the prescriber profile for incident users and the large regional variances raise concerns. It is therefore vital that the use of ADHD drugs is closely monitored.},

RESULTS: The mean duration of ADHD treatment was highest (3.6-4.2 years) for patients initiating therapy at a young age (age{\textless}13).

All age categories showed an increase in the average daily dosage of methylphenidate used from 2003 to 2010. Concomitant treatment with methylphenidate and atomoxetine was rare, as only 2 \% of methylphenidate treatment overlapped with atomoxetine treatment. Nineteen percent of methylphenidate instant-release treatment overlapped with methylphenidate controlled-release treatment. Users of ADHD drugs across all age categories had an increased use of drugs related to the nervous system, especially antipsychotics [standardized morbidity rate (SMR), 6.4-19.5] and antiepileptics (SMR, 4.0-5.5). CONCLUSION: We found certain traits that warrant further investigation: the apparent increase in average daily doses, the low adherence to treatment among off-label users, and the increased use of other psychotropic medication.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Case-only designs have been used since late 1980's. In these, as opposed to case-control or cohort studies for instance, only cases are required and are self-controlled, eliminating selection biases and confounding related to control subjects, and time-invariant characteristics. The objectives of this systematic review were to analyze how the two main case-only designs - case-crossover (CC) and self-controlled case series (SCCS) - have been applied and reported in pharmacoepidemiology literature, in terms of applicability assumptions and specificities of these designs. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We systematically selected all reports in this field involving case-only designs from MEDLINE and EMBASE up to September 15, 2010. Data were extracted using a standardized form. The analysis included 93 reports 50 (54\%) of CC and 45 (48\%) SCCS, 2 reports combined both designs. In 12 (24\%) CC and 18 (40\%) SCCS articles, all applicable validity assumptions of the designs were fulfilled, respectively. Fifty (54\%) articles (15 CC (30\%) and 35 (78\%) SCCS) adequately addressed the specificities of the case-only analyses in the way they reported results. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our systematic review underlines that implementation of CC and SCCS designs needs to be more rigorous with regard to validity assumptions, as well as improvement in results reporting.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Some antipsychotics increases prolactin levels, which might increase the risk of breast cancer. Existing evidence is conflicting and based on sparse data, especially for the increasingly used second-generation antipsychotics. We conducted a nationwide case-control study of the association between antipsychotic use and incident breast cancer. METHODS: From the Danish Cancer Registry, we identified women with a first-time diagnosis of breast cancer 2000-2015 (n=60,360). For each case, we age-matched 10 female population controls. Using conditional logistic regression, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) for breast cancer associated with use of antipsychotics. We stratified antipsychotics by first and- second generation status and by ability to induce elevation of prolactin. RESULTS: 4,951 cases (8.1\%) and 47,643 controls (7.1\%) had ever used antipsychotics. Long-term use ({\textgreater}/=10,000 mg olanzapine equivalents) was associated with breast cancer, with an adjusted OR of 1.18 (95\%CI, 1.06, 1.32). A weak dose-response pattern was seen, with ORs increasing to 1.27 (95\% CI 1.01, 1.59) for {\textgreater}/=50,000mg olanzapine equivalents. Associations were similar for first- and second-generation antipsychotics (ORs 1.17 vs 1.11), but also for non-prolactin inducing antipsychotics (OR 1.17). Stratifying by estrogen receptor status, positive associations were seen for estrogen receptor positive cancers (long-term use: OR 1.29; 95\% CI 1.13, 1.47) while no associations were observed for estrogen receptor negative cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results do not suggest a clinically important association between antipsychotic use and risk of breast cancer. The importance of drug-induced prolactin elevation is unclear but may lead slightly increased risk of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer.},

We investigated whether prenatal exposure to exogenous GC is associated with ADHD. DESIGN: Nationwide cohort study. SETTING: A cohort of 875 996 singletons born alive between 1996 and 2009 in Denmark. Data were obtained from national registries. EXPOSURES: We identified children exposed prenatally to GCs, children unexposed prenatally and born to maternal former users, and children unexposed and born to maternal never users. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We compared ADHD risk in children prenatally exposed to GCs and in children of former GC users with risk in unexposed children of never users. We computed cumulative incidence at 10 years of age and adjusted HRs (aHRs). In addition, we compared exposed children with unexposed siblings in a sibling design. RESULTS: We identified 875 996 children, among whom 5319 were prenatally exposed to systemic GCs and 36 780 to local/inhaled GCs. Cumulative incidences of ADHD at 10 years of age were 2.65\% in prenatally exposed children and 2.03\% in unexposed children of never users. At the general population level, prenatal exposure was associated with ADHD compared with unexposed, with aHR of 1.43(95\% CI 1.24 to 1.65) for systemic exposure and 1.23 (95\% CI 1.15 to 1.31) for local/inhaled exposure. However, our former user analysis (aHR of 1.25 (95\% CI 1.20 to 1.29)) and sibling design (aHR of 1.03 (95\% CI 0.87 to 1.20)) indicated that these findings were due to confounding. CONCLUSION: This study provides no evidence of a causal association between prenatal exposure to GCs and risk of ADHD.},

DESIGN: Nationwide population based cohort study using national registers. SETTING: Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: All Danish residents diagnosed during 1986-2016 as having Lyme neuroborreliosis (n=2067), defined as a positive Borrelia burgdorferi intrathecal antibody test and a clinical diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis, and a comparison cohort from the general population matched on sex and date of birth (n=20 670). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality rate ratios, incidence rate ratios of comorbidities, and differences in educational and social outcomes. RESULTS: Mortality among patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis was not higher than in the general population (mortality rate ratio 0.90, 95\% confidence interval 0.79 to 1.03). Lyme neuroborreliosis patients had increased risk of haematological (incidence rate ratio 3.07, 2.03 to 4.66) and non-melanoma skin cancers (1.49, 1.18 to 1.88). At diagnosis, Lyme neuroborreliosis patients had slightly higher employment and lower disability pension rates. After five years, patients and comparison cohort members had similar numbers of hospital contacts (difference -0.22, 95\% confidence interval -0.45 to 0.02, in-hospital days/year; 0.37, -0.10 to 0.83, outpatient visits/year), employment rates (difference 1.5\%, -2.1\% to 5.1\%), income (difference -1000, -20 000 to 18 000, Danish kroner), days of sick leave (difference -0.3, -3.5 to 3.0, per year), rates of receipt of a disability pension (difference -0.9\%, -3.2\% to 1.3\%), and number of children (difference -0.10, -0.27 to 0.08). More patients were married (difference 4.8\%, 2.2\% to 7.4\%) and had completed high school education (difference 7\%, 1\% to 12\%). CONCLUSION: A verified diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis had no substantial effect on long term survival, health, or educational/social functioning.

Drugs such as methylphenidate, amphetamines and atomoxetine are frequently prescribed as part of management. The use of these drugs has been increasing and significant clinical benefit is achieved but safety has been questioned. In this review, the cardiovascular safety of these drugs is examined with regard to effects on blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), ECG parameters and the risk of sudden death. Methylphenidate appears to cause minor increases in BP and HR. There are no strong data to suggest that methylphenidate increases the corrected QT interval (QTc). Amphetamines appear to cause minor increases in HR and BP over the long term. There is growing evidence to suggest that amphetamines do not cause statistically or clinically significant increases in QTc. Sudden death remains an extremely rare event and there is no clear evidence to attribute this to methylphenidate. Some data even suggest that the risk of sudden death in treated children may be less common than in the background population. Limited data suggest that atomoxetine may increase BP and HR in the short term; in the long term it appears to increase BP. The effects of atomoxetine on QTc remain uncertain. Use of this drug does not appear to be associated with sudden death. Because the current evidence is based on research that has not been specifically designed to investigate the cardiovascular effects of these drugs it is difficult to draw firm conclusions, and further work is required specifically to address these questions.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate whether in addition to established early risk factors other, less studied pre-, peri-, and postnatal influences, like gestational hypertension or neonatal respiratory disorders and infections, may increase a child's risk of developing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). In the IDEFICS study more than 18,000 children, aged 2-11.9 years, underwent extensive medical examinations supplemented by parental questionnaires on pregnancy and early childhood. The present analyses are restricted to children whose parents also completed a supplementary medical questionnaire (n = 15,577), including the question whether or not the child was ever diagnosed with ADHD. Multilevel multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between early life influences and the risk of ADHD. Our study confirms the well-known association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and a child's risk of ADHD. In addition, our study showed that children born to mothers younger than 20 years old were 3-4 times more likely to develop ADHD as compared to children born to mothers aged 25 years and older. Moreover, we found that children whose mothers suffered from pregnancy-induced hypertension had an approximately twofold risk of ADHD (OR 1.95; 95\% CI 1.09-3.48). This also holds true for infections during the first 4 weeks after birth (OR 2.06; 95\% CI 1.05-4.04). In addition, although not statistically significant, we observed a noticeable elevated risk estimate for neonatal respiratory disorders (OR 1.76; 95\% CI 0.91-3.41). Hence, we recommend that these less often studied pre-, peri, and postnatal influences should get more attention when considering early indicators or predictors for ADHD in children.

Many of the studies investigated the risk of specific AEs. In particular, the cardiovascular safety, the impact on growth and on sleep pattern, the risk of substance use disorders and of suicidal ideation are among the topics more studied. Expert opinion: Effective drugs for ADHD appears to be safe and well tolerated. Most of the adverse events reported in the randomised controlled trials are mild and transient. Decreased appetite, growth decrease and the impact on sleep (insomnia for stimulants and somnolence for alpha2-agonists) are among the most common events. Concerns exist about cardiovascular and psychiatric AEs, even if the available evidence does not support an association with medications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adverse-event reports from North America have raised concern that the use of drugs for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study with automated data from four health plans (Tennessee Medicaid, Washington State Medicaid, Kaiser Permanente California, and OptumInsight Epidemiology), with 1,200,438 children and young adults between the ages of 2 and 24 years and 2,579,104 person-years of follow-up, including 373,667 person-years of current use of ADHD drugs. We identified serious cardiovascular events (sudden cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke) from health-plan data and vital records, with end points validated by medical-record review. We estimated the relative risk of end points among current users, as compared with nonusers, with hazard ratios from Cox regression models. RESULTS: Cohort members had 81 serious cardiovascular events (3.1 per 100,000 person-years). Current users of ADHD drugs were not at increased risk for serious cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.75; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.31 to 1.85). Risk was not increased for any of the individual end points, or for current users as compared with former users (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.70; 95\% CI, 0.29 to 1.72). Alternative analyses addressing several study assumptions also showed no significant association between the use of an ADHD drug and the risk of a study end point. CONCLUSIONS: This large study showed no evidence that current use of an ADHD drug was associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events, although the upper limit of the 95\% confidence interval indicated that a doubling of the risk could not be ruled out. However, the absolute magnitude of such an increased risk would be low. (Funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Food and Drug Administration.).},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: More than 1.5 million US adults use stimulants and other medications labeled for treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These agents can increase heart rate and blood pressure, raising concerns about their cardiovascular safety. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether current use of medications prescribed primarily to treat ADHD is associated with increased risk of serious cardiovascular events in young and middle-aged adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective, population-based cohort study using electronic health care records from 4 study sites (OptumInsight Epidemiology, Tennessee Medicaid, Kaiser Permanente California, and the HMO Research Network), starting in 1986 at 1 site and ending in 2005 at all sites, with additional covariate assessment using 2007 survey data. Participants were adults aged 25 through 64 years with dispensed prescriptions for methylphenidate, amphetamine, or atomoxetine at baseline. Each medication user (n = 150,359) was matched to 2 nonusers on study site, birth year, sex, and calendar year (443,198 total users and nonusers). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction (MI), sudden cardiac death (SCD), or stroke, with comparison between current or new users and remote users to account for potential healthy-user bias. RESULTS: During 806,182 person-years of follow-up (median, 1.3 years per person), 1357 cases of MI, 296 cases of SCD, and 575 cases of stroke occurred. There were 107,322 person-years of current use (median, 0.33 years), with a crude incidence per 1000 person-years of 1.34 (95\% CI, 1.14-1.57) for MI, 0.30 (95\% CI, 0.20-0.42) for SCD, and 0.56 (95\% CI, 0.43-0.72) for stroke. The multivariable-adjusted rate ratio (RR) of serious cardiovascular events for current use vs nonuse of ADHD medications was 0.83 (95\% CI, 0.72-0.96). Among new users of ADHD medications, the adjusted RR was 0.77 (95\% CI, 0.63-0.94). The adjusted RR for current use vs remote use was 1.03 (95\% CI, 0.86-1.24); for new use vs remote use, the adjusted RR was 1.02 (95\% CI, 0.82-1.28); the upper limit of 1.28 corresponds to an additional 0.19 events per 1000 person-years at ages 25-44 years and 0.77 events per 1000 person-years at ages 45-64 years. CONCLUSIONS: Among young and middle-aged adults, current or new use of ADHD medications, compared with nonuse or remote use, was not associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events. Apparent protective associations likely represent healthy-user bias.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to determine whether use of methylphenidate in adults is associated with elevated rates of serious cardiovascular events compared with rates in nonusers. METHOD: This was a cohort study of new users of methylphenidate based on administrative data from a five-state Medicaid database and a 14-state commercial insurance database. All new methylphenidate users with at least 180 days of prior enrollment were identified. Users were matched on data source, state, sex, and age to as many as four comparison subjects who did not use methylphenidate, amphetamines, or atomoxetine. A total of 43,999 new methylphenidate users were identified and matched to 175,955 nonusers. Events of primary interest were 1) sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, 2) stroke, 3) myocardial infarction, and 4) a composite endpoint of stroke or myocardial infarction. RESULTS: The age-standardized incidence rate per 1,000 person-years of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia was 2.17 (95\% CI=1.63-2.83) in methylphenidate users and 0.98 (95\% CI=0.89-1.08) in nonusers, for an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.84 (95\% CI=1.33-2.55). Dosage was inversely associated with risk. Adjusted hazard ratios for stroke, myocardial infarction, and the composite endpoint of stroke or myocardial infarction did not differ statistically from 1. CONCLUSIONS: Although initiation of methylphenidate was associated with a 1.8-fold increase in risk of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, the lack of a dose-response relationship suggests that this association may not be a causal one.},

Public health concerns are amplified by increasing use of prescription stimulants among adults. METHODS: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the evidence of an association between prescription stimulant use and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar searches were conducted using key words related to these topics (MESH): ADHD; Adults; Amphetamine; Amphetamines; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular System; Central Nervous Stimulants; Cerebrovascular; Cohort Studies; Case-control Studies; Death; Death, Sudden, Cardiac; Dextroamphetamine; Drug Toxicity; Methamphetamine; Methylphenidate; Myocardial Infarction; Stimulant; Stroke; Safety. Eligible studies were population-based studies of children, adolescents, or adults using prescription stimulant use as the independent variable and a hard cardiovascular outcome as the dependent variable. RESULTS: Ten population-based observational studies which evaluated prescription stimulant use with cardiovascular outcomes were reviewed. Six out of seven studies in children and adolescents did not show an association between stimulant use and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. In contrast, two out of three studies in adults found an association. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of an association between prescription stimulant use and adverse cardiovascular outcomes are mixed. Studies of children and adolescents suggest that statistical power is limited in available study populations, and the absolute risk of an event is low. More suggestive of a safety signal, studies of adults found an increased risk for transient ischemic attack and sudden death/ventricular arrhythmia. Interpretation was limited due to differences in population, cardiovascular outcome selection/ascertainment, and methodology. Accounting for confounding and selection biases in these studies is of particular concern. Future studies should address this and other methodological issues.},

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of new amphetamines (n=38,586) or atomoxetine (n=20,995) users. Each medication user was matched to up to four non-users on age, gender, data source, and state (n=238,183). The following events were primary outcomes of interest 1) sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, 2) stroke, 3) myocardial infarction, 4) a composite endpoint of stroke or myocardial infarction. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to calculate propensity-adjusted hazard ratios for amphetamines versus matched non-users and atomoxetine versus matched non-users, with intracluster dependence within matched sets accounted for using a robust sandwich estimator. RESULTS: The propensity-score adjusted hazard ratio for amphetamines use versus non-use was 1.18 (95\% CI: 0.55-2.54) for sudden death/ventricular arrhythmia, 0.80 (95\% CI: 0.44-1.47) for stroke, 0.75 (95\% CI: 0.42-1.35) for myocardial infarction, and 0.78 (95\% CI: 0.51-1.19) for stroke/myocardial infarction.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Systematically review and synthesize the clinical evidence of treatments for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) by indirectly comparing established treatments in the UK with a drug recently approved in Europe (lisdexamfetamine [LDX]). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: POPULATION: children and adolescents. SETTING: Europe. Comparators: methylphenidate (MPH), atomoxetine (ATX), and dexamphetamine (DEX). Electronic databases and relevant conference proceedings were searched for randomized, controlled clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety of at least one of the comparators and LDX. Quality assessments for each included trial were performed using criteria recommended by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Network meta-analysis methods for dichotomous outcomes were employed to evaluate treatment efficacy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Response, as defined by either a reduction from baseline of at least 25\% in the ADHD Rating Scale [ADHD-RS] total score or, separately, as assessed on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement [CGI-I] scale, and safety (all-cause withdrawals and withdrawal due to adverse events). RESULTS: The systematic review found 32 trials for the meta-analysis, including data on LDX, ATX, and different formulations of MPH. No trials for DEX meeting the inclusion criteria were found. Sufficient data were identified for each outcome: ADHD-RS, 16 trials; CGI-I, 20 trials; all-cause withdrawals, 28 trials; and withdrawals due to adverse events, 27 trials. The relative probability of treatment response for CGI-I (95\% confidence intervals [CI]) for ATX versus LDX was 0.65 (0.53-0.78); for long-acting MPH versus LDX, 0.82 (0.69-0.97); for intermediate release MPH versus LDX, 0.51 (0.40-0.65); and for short-acting MPH versus LDX, 0.62 (0.51-0.76). The relative probabilities of ADHD-RS treatment response also favored LDX. CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of ADHD, the synthesis of efficacy data showed statistically significant better probabilities of response with LDX than for formulations of MPH or ATX. The analysis of safety data proved inconclusive due to low event rates. These results may be limited by the studies included, which only investigated the short-term efficacy of medications in patients without comorbid disorders.},

METHODS: A 1-year decision-analytic model was constructed, with the health outcomes "response", "nonresponse", and "unable to tolerate". Clinical data were taken from a head-to-head, randomized controlled trial in inadequate responders to methylphenidate. Response to treatment was defined as a score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement subscale. Tolerability was assessed by discontinuation rates owing to adverse events. Utility weights were identified via a systematic literature review. Healthcare resource use estimates were obtained via a survey of clinicians. Daily drug costs were derived from British National Formulary 2012 costs and mean doses reported in the trial. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) were performed. RESULTS: The comparison of LDX with atomoxetine resulted in an estimate of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound1802 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The result was robust in a wide range of sensitivity analyses; results were most sensitive to changes in drug costs and efficacy. In the PSA, assuming a maximum willingness to pay of pound20,000 per QALY, LDX versus atomoxetine had an 86 \% probability of being cost effective. In 38 \% of PSA runs, LDX was more effective and less costly than atomoxetine. CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of the UK NHS, LDX provides a cost-effective treatment option for children and adolescents who are inadequate responders to methylphenidate.},

This meta-analysis examines the efficacy and tolerability of the stimulant Lisdexamfetamine (LDX) as an add-on strategy in those with MDD who have failed to respond to an antidepressant. METHOD: Randomized control trials were identified and extracted from Pubmed; Web of Science; PsychINFO; and Cochrane Library. The efficacy of LDX was evaluated using Hedges' g and Odds Ratio, whereas Risk Difference was used to assess the safety and tolerability of LDX. RESULTS: Four studies met inclusion criteria. LDX did not demonstrate superiority in efficacy relative to placebo as indicated by a Hedges' g score of 0.126 (95\% CI -0.040-0.291; p = 0.136) for mean change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Odds ratios of 1.206 (95\% CI 0.745-1.954; p = 0.446) and 1.244 (95\% CI 0.959-1.614; p = 0.1) were found for remission and response rates respectively. Risk differences of -0.1 (95\% CI -0.155-(-0.045); p {\textless} 0.001) indicated a 10\% increase chance of developing treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) in the LDX group. There was no significant difference in risk for developing serious or severe TEAE and discontinuing treatment due to TEAE. LIMITATIONS: The number of included studies was small and only one metric was available for analysis of antidepressant efficacy of LDX. CONCLUSIONS: LDX when used as antidepressant augmentation produced a small effect in improving depressive symptoms that approached trend-level significance and demonstrated comparable tolerability to placebo. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal clinical subset of depressive symptoms responsive to LDX augmentation.},

Some concern the practical realities of clinical research on patients. Others are to do with the value and purpose of balance. Still others are to do with a confusion about the role of conditioning in valid statistical inference. I consider a simple game of chance involving two dice to illustrate some points about inference and then consider the seven misunderstandings in turn. I conclude that although one should not make a fetish of randomisation, when proposing alternatives to randomisation in clinical trials, one should be very careful to be precise about the exact nature of the alternative being considered if one is to avoid the danger of underestimating the advantages that randomisation can offer.},

A second method for strengthening associations is to reduce non-differential misclassification, which tends to dilute associations.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the risk of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and neonatal bleeding complications associated with late-pregnancy exposure to anticonvulsant drugs (ACDs) that induce cytochrome P450 enzymes (ACDi) and alter the metabolism of vitamin K compared to other ACDs. METHODS: We used a population-based cohort study stemming from a nationwide sample of publicly insured pregnant women with a liveborn infant from the 2000 to 2010 Medicaid Analytic eXtract. ACDi (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, oxcarbazepine, topiramate) were compared to other ACDs dispensed during the last month of pregnancy. Relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) of PPH and neonatal bleeding complications were estimated using generalized linear models with fine stratification on the propensity score to control for indication and other potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 11,572 women with an ACD prescription overlapping delivery, 2.6\% (135/5,109) in the ACDi group and 3.6\% (231/6,463) in the other ACDs group had a diagnosis of PPH: unadjusted RR 0.74 (95\% CI 0.60-0.91), adjusted RR 0.77 (95\% CI 0.58-1.00). The prevalence of neonatal bleeding complications was 3.1\% (157/5,109) in the ACDi group and 3.5\% (229/6,463) in the other ACDs group: unadjusted RR 0.87 (95\% CI 0.71-1.06), adjusted RR 0.83 (95\% CI 0.64-1.08). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this large observational study suggests that use of ACDi near delivery does not increase the risk of bleeding complications compared to other ACDs in clinical settings where neonatal intramuscular or oral vitamin K administration is considered standard of care. These findings provide reassurance for clinicians and pregnant women successfully treated with ACDi.},

In the presence of considerable dropout, this can imply substantial information loss and consequently imprecise effect estimates. In this article, we aim to increase the efficiency of IPCW G-estimators under a SNFTM by deriving an augmented estimator that uses both censored and uncensored observations, and offers robustness against misspecification of the model for the censoring process, provided that a model for a specific functional of the survival time and time-dependent covariates is correctly specified. The empirical properties of the proposed estimators are studied in a simulation experiment, and the estimators are used in the analysis of surveillance data from the field of hospital epidemiology.},

DESIGN: Series of 252 nationwide cohort studies, each mimicking the strict design criteria of a clinical trial (emulated trial design). SETTING: Danish, nationwide, population based health registries (1996-2016). PARTICIPANTS: Individuals eligible for inclusion were all adults without malignancy; schizophrenia; dementia; or cardiovascular, kidney, liver, or ulcer diseases (that is, with low baseline risk). The study included 1 370 832 diclofenac initiators, 3 878 454 ibuprofen initiators, 291 490 naproxen initiators, 764 781 healthcare seeking paracetamol initiators matched by propensity score, and 1 303 209 healthcare seeking non-initiators also matched by propensity score. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compute the intention to treat hazard ratio (as a measure of the incidence rate ratio) of major adverse cardiovascular events within 30 days of initiation. RESULTS: The adverse event rate among diclofenac initiators increased by 50\% compared with non-initiators (incidence rate ratio 1.5, 95\% confidence interval 1.4 to 1.7), 20\% compared with paracetamol or ibuprofen initiators (both 1.2, 1.1 to 1.3), and 30\% compared with naproxen initiators (1.3, 1.1 to 1.5). The event rate for diclofenac initiators increased for each component of the combined endpoint (1.2 (1.1 to 1.4) for atrial fibrillation/flutter, 1.6 (1.3 to 2.0) for ischaemic stroke, 1.7 (1.4 to 2.0) for heart failure, 1.9 (1.6 to 2.2) for myocardial infarction, and 1.7 (1.4 to 2.1) for cardiac death) as well as for low doses of diclofenac, compared with non-initiators. Although the relative risk of major adverse cardiovascular events was highest in individuals with low or moderate baseline risk (that is, diabetes mellitus), the absolute risk was highest in individuals with high baseline risk (that is, previous myocardial infarction or heart failure). Diclofenac initiation also increased the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding at 30 days, by approximately 4.5-fold compared with no initiation, 2.5-fold compared with initiation of ibuprofen or paracetamol, and to a similar extent as naproxen initiation. CONCLUSIONS: Diclofenac poses a cardiovascular health risk compared with non-use, paracetamol use, and use of other traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.},

MS and pregnancy outcomes (infections, Cesarean section, preterm delivery, poor fetal growth, preeclampsia, chorioamnionitis, postpartum hemorrhage, stillbirth, infant malformations) were identified during pregnancy and at delivery. We calculated adjusted risk ratios by MS status and relapses in the year before delivery. Among over 5 million pregnancies, we identified 3,875 in women with MS. Women with MS had an increased risk of infections during pregnancy (adjusted risk ratio Truven: 1.22 [95\% confidence interval \{CI\}: 1.16, 1.27]) and preterm delivery (Truven 1.19 [95\% CI: 1.04, 1.35]; Nationwide Inpatient Sample 1.30 [95\% CI: 1.16, 1.44]). The risk of other outcomes was similar for women with and without MS. In Truven, risk ratios of the pregnancy outcomes in women experiencing relapses versus those without relapses were between 0.9 and 1.4, and confidence intervals overlapped the null. Overall, women with MS had an increased risk of infections and preterm delivery, however, their risks for other adverse pregnancy outcomes were not elevated.

METHODS: Self-reported MSDP and asthma data were extracted from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2012. The association between self-reported MSDP and asthma was adjusted for exposure misclassification using a Bayesian bias model approach. RESULTS: We included 3074 subjects who were 1-15 years of age, including 492 asthma cases. The mean (SD) of age of the participants was 8.5 (4.1) and 7.1 (4.2) years and the number (percentage) of female was 205 (42\%) and 1314 (51\%) among asthmatic and nonasthmatic groups, respectively. The odds ratio (OR) for the association between self-reported MSDP and asthma in logistic regression adjusted for confounders was 1.28 (95\% confidence interval: 0.92, 1.77). In a Bayesian analysis that adjusted for exposure misclassification using external data, we found different ORs between MSDP and asthma by applying different priors (posterior ORs 0.90 [95\% credible interval \{CRI\}: 0.47, 1.60] to 3.05 [95\% CRI: 1.73, 5.53] in differential and 1.22 [CRI 95\%: 0.62, 2.25] to 1.60 CRI: 1.18, 2.19) in nondifferential misclassification settings. CONCLUSIONS: Given the assumptions and the accuracy of the bias model, the estimated effect of MSDP on asthma after adjusting for misclassification was strengthened in many scenarios.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: To date, this is the first population-based study to examine the recurrence risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), including time trends, and the first study to consider the ASDs recurrence risk for full- and half-siblings. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the relative recurrence risk for ASDs in a Danish population, including recurrence in full- and half-siblings, and to examine time trends in ASDs relative to the recurrence risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based cohort study in Denmark. All children (about 1.5 million) born in Denmark between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2004, were identified and followed up to December 31, 2010. We identified a maternal sibling subcohort derived from mothers with at least 2 children and a paternal sibling subcohort derived from fathers with at least 2 children. EXPOSURES: Children having an older sibling with ASDs are compared with children not having an older sibling with ASDs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The adjusted hazard ratio for ASDs among children having an older sibling with ASDs compared with children not having an older sibling with ASDs. RESULTS The overall relative recurrence risk for ASDs was 6.9 (95\% CI, 6.1-7.8), and it did not change significantly over time; similar risks were observed in maternal and paternal full-siblings. The relative recurrence risks were 2.4 (95\% CI, 1.4-4.1) for maternal half-siblings and 1.5 (95\% CI, 0.7-3.4) for paternal half-siblings. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our population-based recurrence risk estimate is lower than the recently reported estimates from clinical samples. Our results demonstrate no time trend in the ASDs recurrence risk as seen in the ASDs prevalence. The difference in the recurrence risk between full- and half-siblings supports the role of genetics in ASDs, while the significant recurrence risk in maternal half-siblings may support the role of factors associated with pregnancy and the maternal intrauterine environment in ASDs.},

	abstract = {Causal inference with observational longitudinal data and time-varying exposures is complicated due to the potential for time-dependent confounding and unmeasured confounding. Most causal inference methods that handle time-dependent confounding rely on either the assumption of no unmeasured confounders or the availability of an unconfounded variable that is associated with the exposure (eg, an instrumental variable). Furthermore, when data are incomplete, validity of many methods often depends on the assumption of missing at random. We propose an approach that combines a parametric joint mixed-effects model for the study outcome and the exposure with g-computation to identify and estimate causal effects in the presence of time-dependent confounding and unmeasured confounding. G-computation can estimate participant-specific or population-average causal effects using parameters of the joint model. The joint model is a type of shared parameter model where the outcome and exposure-selection models share common random effect(s). We also extend the joint model to handle missing data and truncation by death when missingness is possibly not at random. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method using simulation studies and compare the method to both linear mixed- and fixed-effects models combined with g-computation as well as to targeted maximum likelihood estimation. We apply the method to an epidemiologic study of vitamin D and depressive symptoms in older adults and include code using SAS PROC NLMIXED software to enhance the accessibility of the method to applied researchers.},

	abstract = {Analysis of a large longitudinal study of children motivated our work. The results illustrate how accurate inference for fixed effects in a general linear mixed model depends on the covariance model selected for the data. Simulation studies have revealed biased inference for the fixed effects with an underspecified covariance structure, at least in small samples. One underspecification common for longitudinal data assumes a simple random intercept and conditional independence of the within-subject errors (i.e., compound symmetry). We prove that the underspecification creates bias in both small and large samples, indicating that recruiting more participants will not alleviate inflation of the Type I error rate associated with fixed effect inference. Enumerations and simulations help quantify the bias and evaluate strategies for avoiding it. When practical, backwards selection of the covariance model, starting with an unstructured pattern, provides the best protection. Tutorial papers can guide the reader in minimizing the chances of falling into the often spurious software trap of nonconvergence. In some cases, the logic of the study design and the scientific context may support a structured pattern, such as an autoregressive structure. The sandwich estimator provides a valid alternative in sufficiently large samples. Authors reporting mixed-model analyses should note possible biases in fixed effects inference because of the following: (i) the covariance model selection process; (ii) the specific covariance model chosen; or (iii) the test approximation.},

When there are time-varying confounders, which may include past outcomes, affected by prior exposure, standard regression methods can lead to bias. Methods such as inverse probability weighted estimation of marginal structural models have been developed to address this problem. However, in this paper we show how standard regression methods can be used, even in the presence of time-dependent confounding, to estimate the total effect of an exposure on a subsequent outcome by controlling appropriately for prior exposures, outcomes, and time-varying covariates. We refer to the resulting estimation approach as sequential conditional mean models (SCMMs), which can be fitted using generalized estimating equations. We outline this approach and describe how including propensity score adjustment is advantageous. We compare the causal effects being estimated using SCMMs and marginal structural models, and we compare the two approaches using simulations. SCMMs enable more precise inferences, with greater robustness against model misspecification via propensity score adjustment, and easily accommodate continuous exposures and interactions. A new test for direct effects of past exposures on a subsequent outcome is described.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In observational studies, epidemiologists often attempt to estimate the total effect of an exposure on an outcome of interest. However, when the underlying diagram is unknown and limited knowledge is available, dissecting bias performances is essential to estimating the total effect of an exposure on an outcome when mistakenly adjusting for mediators under logistic regression. Through simulation, we focused on six causal diagrams concerning different roles of mediators. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the bias performances of varying across exposure-mediator effects and mediator-outcome effects when adjusting for the mediator. SETTING: Based on the causal relationships in the real world, we compared the biases of varying across the effects of exposure-mediator with those of varying across the effects of mediator-outcome when adjusting for the mediator. The magnitude of the bias was defined by the difference between the estimated effect (using logistic regression) and the total effect of the exposure on the outcome. RESULTS: In four scenarios (a single mediator, two series mediators, two independent parallel mediators or two correlated parallel mediators), the biases of varying across the effects of exposure-mediator were greater than those of varying across the effects of mediator-outcome when adjusting for the mediator. In contrast, in two other scenarios (a single mediator or two independent parallel mediators in the presence of unobserved confounders), the biases of varying across the effects of exposure-mediator were less than those of varying across the effects of mediator-outcome when adjusting for the mediator. CONCLUSIONS: The biases were more sensitive to the variation of effects of exposure-mediator than the effects of mediator-outcome when adjusting for the mediator in the absence of unobserved confounders, while the biases were more sensitive to the variation of effects of mediator-outcome than those of exposure-mediator in the presence of an unobserved confounder.},

	abstract = {This article provides an overview of recent developments in mediation analysis, that is, analyses used to assess the relative magnitude of different pathways and mechanisms by which an exposure may affect an outcome. Traditional approaches to mediation in the biomedical and social sciences are described. Attention is given to the confounding assumptions required for a causal interpretation of direct and indirect effect estimates. Methods from the causal inference literature to conduct mediation in the presence of exposure-mediator interactions, binary outcomes, binary mediators, and case-control study designs are presented. Sensitivity analysis techniques for unmeasured confounding and measurement error are introduced. Discussion is given to extensions to time-to-event outcomes and multiple mediators. Further flexible modeling strategies arising from the precise counterfactual definitions of direct and indirect effects are also described. The focus throughout is on methodology that is easily implementable in practice across a broad range of potential applications.},

Clearly, causality must operate in time and we show how this corresponds to a mechanistic, or system, understanding of causality. The established counterfactual definitions of direct and indirect effects depend on an ability to manipulate the mediator which may not hold in practice, and we argue that a mechanistic view may be better. Graphical representations based on local independence graphs and dynamic path analysis are used to facilitate communication as well as providing an overview of the dynamic relations 'at a glance'. The relationship between causality as understood in a mechanistic and in an interventionist sense is discussed. An example using data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study is presented.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data-adaptive approaches to confounding adjustment may improve performance beyond expert knowledge when analyzing electronic healthcare databases and have additional practical advantages for analyzing multiple databases in rapid cycles. Improvements seemed possible if outcome predictors were reliably identified empirically and adjusted. METHODS: In five cohort studies from diverse healthcare databases, we implemented a base-case high-dimensional propensity score algorithm with propensity score decile-adjusted outcome models to estimate treatment effects among prescription drug initiators. The original variable selection procedure based on the estimated bias of each variable using unadjusted associations between confounders and exposure (RRCE) and disease outcome (RRCD) was augmented by alternative strategies. These included using increasingly adjusted RRCD estimates, including models considering {\textgreater}1,500 variables jointly (Lasso, Bayesian logistic regression); using prediction statistics or likelihood-ratio statistics for covariate prioritization; directly estimating the propensity score with {\textgreater}1,500 variables (Lasso, Bayesian regression); or directly fitting an outcome model using all covariates jointly (Lasso, Ridge). RESULTS: In five example studies, most tested augmentations of the base-case hdPS did not meaningfully change estimates in light of wide confidence intervals except for Bayesian regression and Lasso to estimate RRCD, which moved estimates minimally closer to the expectation in three of five examples. The direct outcome estimation with Lasso performed worst. CONCLUSION: Overall, the basic heuristic of variable reduction in high-dimensional propensity score adjustment performed, as well as alternative approaches in diverse settings. Minor improvements in variable selection may be possible using Bayesian outcome regression to prioritize variables for propensity score estimation when outcomes are rare.

DESIGN: Population based retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Nationwide sample of patients with type 2 diabetes from a large de-identified US commercial healthcare database (Optum Clinformatics Datamart). PARTICIPANTS: Three pairwise 1:1 propensity score matched cohorts of patients with type 2 diabetes 18 years and older who initiated canagliflozin or a comparator non-gliflozin antidiabetic agent (ie, a DPP-4i, a GLP-1RA, or a sulfonylurea) between April 2013 and September 2015. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were heart failure admission to hospital and a composite cardiovascular endpoint (comprised of being admitted to hospital for acute myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or hemorrhagic stroke). Hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals were estimated in each propensity score matched cohort controlling for more than 100 baseline characteristics. RESULTS: During a 30 month period, the hazard ratio for heart failure admission to hospital associated with canagliflozin was 0.70 (95\% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.92) versus a DPP-4i (n=17 667 pairs), 0.61 (0.47 to 0.78) versus a GLP-1RA (20 539), and 0.51 (0.38 to 0.67) versus a sulfonylurea (17 354 ). The hazard ratio for the composite cardiovascular endpoint associated with canagliflozin was 0.89 (0.68 to 1.17) versus a DPP-4i, 1.03 (0.79 to 1.35) versus a GLP-1RA, and 0.86 (0.65 to 1.13) versus a sulfonylurea. Results were similar in sensitivity analyses further adjusting for baseline hemoglobin A1c levels and in subgroups of patients with and without prior cardiovascular disease or heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort study, canagliflozin was associated with a lower risk of heart failure admission to hospital and with a similar risk of myocardial infarction or stroke in direct comparisons with three different classes of non-gliflozin diabetes treatment alternatives as used in routine care.},

	abstract = {Background: Decision makers in health care increasingly rely on nonrandomized database analyses to assess the effectiveness, safety, and value of medical products. Health care data scientists use data-adaptive approaches that automatically optimize confounding control to study causal treatment effects. This article summarizes relevant experiences and extensions. Methods: The literature was reviewed on the uses of high-dimensional propensity score (HDPS) and related approaches for health care database analyses, including methodological articles on their performance and improvement. Articles were grouped into applications, comparative performance studies, and statistical simulation experiments. Results: The HDPS algorithm has been referenced frequently with a variety of clinical applications and data sources from around the world. The appeal of HDPS for database research rests in 1) its superior performance in situations of unobserved confounding through proxy adjustment, 2) its predictable efficiency in extracting confounding information from a given data source, 3) its ability to automate estimation of causal treatment effects to the extent achievable in a given data source, and 4) its independence of data source and coding system. Extensions of the HDPS approach have focused on improving variable selection when exposure is sparse, using free text information and time-varying confounding adjustment. Conclusion: Semiautomated and optimized confounding adjustment in health care database analyses has proven successful across a wide range of settings. Machine-learning extensions further automate its use in estimating causal treatment effects across a range of data scenarios.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Both propensity score (PS) matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) allow causal contrasts, albeit different ones. In the presence of effect-measure modification, different analytic approaches produce different summary estimates. METHODS: We present a spreadsheet example that assumes a dichotomous exposure, covariate, and outcome. The covariate can be a confounder or not and a modifier of the relative risk (RR) or not. Based on expected cell counts, we calculate RR estimates using five summary estimators: Mantel-Haenszel (MH), maximum likelihood (ML), the standardized mortality ratio (SMR), PS matching, and a common implementation of IPTW. RESULTS: Without effect-measure modification, all approaches produce identical results. In the presence of effect-measure modification and regardless of the presence of confounding, results from the SMR and PS are identical, but IPTW can produce strikingly different results (e.g., RR = 0.83 vs. RR = 1.50). In such settings, MH and ML do not estimate a population parameter and results for those measures fall between PS and IPTW. CONCLUSIONS: Discrepancies between PS and IPTW reflect different weighting of stratum-specific effect estimates. SMR and PS matching assign weights according to the distribution of the effect-measure modifier in the exposed subpopulation, whereas IPTW assigns weights according to the distribution of the entire study population. In pharmacoepidemiology, contraindications to treatment that also modify the effect might be prevalent in the population, but would be rare among the exposed. In such settings, estimating the effect of exposure in the exposed rather than the whole population is preferable.},

OBJECTIVES: To describe how information on additional confounders from validation studies can help address the problem of unmeasured confounding in the main study. RESEARCH DESIGN: Review types of validation studies that allow adjustment for unmeasured confounding and illustrate these with an example. SUBJECTS: Main study: New Jersey residents age 65 years or older hospitalized between 1995 and 1997, who filled prescriptions within Medicaid or a pharmaceutical assistance program. Validation study: representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries. MEASURES: Association between nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and mortality. RESULTS: Validation studies are categorized as internal (ie, additional information is collected on participants of the main study) or external. Availability of information on disease outcome will affect choice of analytic strategies. Using an external validation study without data on disease outcome to adjust for unmeasured confounding, propensity score calibration (PSC) leads to a plausible estimate of the association between NSAIDs and mortality in the elderly, if the biases caused by measured and unmeasured confounders go in the same direction. CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of drug effects can be adjusted for confounders that are not available in the main, but can be measured in a validation study. PSC uses validation data without information on disease outcome under a strong assumption. The collection and integration of validation data in pharmacoepidemiology should be encouraged.},

METHODS: Four basic approaches to sensitivity analysis were identified: (1) sensitivity analyses based on an array of informed assumptions; (2) analyses to identify the strength of residual confounding that would be necessary to explain an observed drug-outcome association; (3) external adjustment of a drug-outcome association given additional information on single binary confounders from survey data using algebraic solutions; (4) external adjustment considering the joint distribution of multiple confounders of any distribution from external sources of information using propensity score calibration. CONCLUSION: Sensitivity analyses and external adjustments can improve our understanding of the effects of drugs and biologics in epidemiologic database studies.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Studies of the real-world comparative effectiveness of drugs conducted using computerized healthcare databases typically involve an incident new-user cohort design for head-to-head comparisons between two medications, using exclusively treatment-naive patients. However, the desired contrast often involves one new drug compared with an older drug, of which many users of the new drug may have switched from, seriously restricting the scope of incident new-user studies. METHODS: We introduce prevalent new-user cohort designs for head-to-head comparative drug effect studies, where incident new users are scarce. We define time-based and prescription-based exposure sets to compute time-conditional propensity scores of initiating the newer drug and to identify matched subjects receiving the comparator drug. We illustrate this approach using data from the UK's Clinical Practice Research Datalink to evaluate whether the newer glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 analogs) used to treat type 2 diabetes increase the risk of heart failure, in comparison with the older similarly indicated sulfonylureas. RESULTS: Of the 170 031 users of antidiabetic agents from 2000 onwards, 79 682 used sulfonylureas (first use 2000), while 6196 used GLP-1 analogs (first use 2007), 75\% of which had previously used a sulfonylurea. After matching each GLP-1 analog user to a sulfonylurea user on the time-conditional propensity scores from prescription-based exposure sets, the hazard ratio of heart failure with GLP-1 use was 0.73 (95\%CI: 0.57-0.93). CONCLUSION: The proposed prevalent new-user cohort design for comparative drug effects studies allows the use of all or most patients exposed to the newer drug, thus permitting a more comprehensive assessment of a new drug's safety.

Quetiapine is the most commonly prescribed medication in this class, and therefore a better understanding of its reproductive safety profile is critical. The goal of this study was to determine the risk of major malformations among infants exposed to quetiapine during pregnancy compared with a group of infants whose mothers had a history of psychiatric morbidity but who did not use a second-generation antipsychotic during pregnancy. METHOD: The National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics interviews pregnant women ages 18-45 during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Obstetric, labor, and delivery medical records and pediatric medical records from the first 6 months of life were screened for evidence of major malformations, followed by adjudication by a blinded dysmorphologist. Women with first-trimester exposure to quetiapine were compared with control subjects without exposure to second-generation antipsychotics. RESULTS: As of March 2017, 888 women had enrolled prospectively and 357 were eligible for analysis. Of these, 152 women with first-trimester exposure to quetiapine were compared with 205 control subjects without any second-generation antipsychotic exposure. For the 155 infants born to women in the exposed group (including three sets of twins), two major malformations were confirmed (1.3\%), compared with three major malformations among the 210 infants born in the unexposed group (including five sets of twins) (1.4\%). The unadjusted odds ratio for major malformations between infants with and without quetiapine exposure was 0.90 (95\% CI=0.15, 5.46), which is consistent with the pooled estimate of the available controlled data on fetal exposure to quetiapine. CONCLUSIONS: These data regarding the safety of fetal exposure to quetiapine in a small sample of well-characterized participants are reassuring given that the confidence interval does not exceed a fivefold increased risk of major malformations relative to psychiatric control subjects. Future analyses based on ongoing data collection will produce more precise estimates.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to examine the association between paternal selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use before conception and the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. DESIGN: A population-based cohort study. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of 669 922 children born from 1998 to 2008, with follow-up throughout 2013. Based on Danish national registers, we linked information on paternal use of SSRIs, ASD diagnosed in children and a range of potential confounders. The children whose fathers used SSRIs during the last 3 months prior to conception were identified as the exposed. Cox regression model was used to estimate the HR for ASD in children. RESULTS: Compared with unexposed children, the exposed had a 1.62-fold higher risk of ASD (95\% CI 1.33 to 1.96) and the risk attenuated after adjusting for potential confounders, especially fathers' psychiatric conditions (HR=1.43, 95\% CI 1.18 to 1.74). When extending the exposure window to 1 year before conception, the increased risk persisted in children of fathers using SSRIs only from the last year until the last 3 months prior to conception (HR=1.54, 95\% CI 1.21 to 1.94) but not in children of fathers using SSRIs only during the last 3 months prior to conception (HR=1.17, 95\% CI 0.75 to 1.82). We also performed stratified analyses according to paternal history of affective disorders and observed no increased ASD risk among children whose father had affective disorders. Besides, the sibling analysis showed that the ASD risk did not increase among exposed children compared with their unexposed siblings. CONCLUSIONS: The mildly increased risk of ASD in the offspring associated with paternal SSRI use before conception may be attributable to paternal underlying psychiatric indications related to SSRI use or other unmeasured confounding factors.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the association between atomoxetine and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and transient ischemic attack (TIA) in adults. METHODS: This cohort study conducted within a health insurance database included 21,606 atomoxetine initiators matched to 21,606 stimulant attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication initiators on the basis of propensity scores and a sample from the source population (N = 42,993). Outcomes were confirmed through a medical record review or a National Death Index search. Poisson regression was used to estimate the rate ratio and 95\% confidence interval (CI) of CVA or TIA according to the treatment. Cox regression was used to estimate the hazards ratio (HR) and 95\% CI for comparisons across cohorts. RESULTS: Forty-four CVAs and 21 TIAs occurred during a mean follow-up of 1.5 years. The rate ratio of the current atomoxetine compared with the current stimulant ADHD medication was 1.38 for CVA (95\% CI, 0.42-4.54) and 0.31 for TIA (95\% CI, 0.04-2.63). Results for atomoxetine compared with the stimulant ADHD medication according to initial cohort assignment were consistent, with no increased risk for CVA or TIA. An increased risk of TIA was observed between initiation of an ADHD medication compared with the general population (HR, 3.44; 95\% CI, 1.13-10.60); however, a similar pattern was not observed for CVA (HR, 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.34-1.47). CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support an increased risk of CV events with atomoxetine compared with the stimulant ADHD medication. Users of ADHD medications may be at an increased risk of TIA compared with the general population.},

Marginal structural Cox models (MSCMs) can provide distinct advantages over traditional approaches by allowing adjustment for time-varying confounders such as MS relapses, as well as baseline characteristics, through the use of inverse probability weighting. We assessed the suitability of MSCMs to analyze data from a large cohort of 1,697 relapsing-remitting MS patients in British Columbia, Canada (1995-2008). In the context of this observational study, which spanned more than a decade and involved patients with a chronic yet fluctuating disease, the recently proposed "normalized stabilized" weights were found to be the most appropriate choice of weights. Using this model, no association between beta-interferon exposure and the hazard of disability progression was found (hazard ratio = 1.36, 95\% confidence interval: 0.95, 1.94). For sensitivity analyses, truncated normalized unstabilized weights were used in additional MSCMs and to construct inverse probability weight-adjusted survival curves; the findings did not change. Additionally, qualitatively similar conclusions from approximation approaches to the weighted Cox model (i.e., MSCM) extend confidence in the findings.},

This study was performed in a subset of participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (1987-2010), a US study designed to investigate risk factors for atherosclerosis. General obesity was defined as body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2) {\textgreater}/=30, and abdominal obesity (AOB) was defined according to either waist circumference ({\textgreater}/=102 cm in men and {\textgreater}/=88 cm in women) or waist:hip ratio ({\textgreater}/=0.9 in men and {\textgreater}/=0.85 in women). The association of obesity with CHD was estimated by G-estimation and compared with results from accelerated failure-time models using 3 specifications. The first model, which adjusted for baseline covariates, excluding metabolic mediators of obesity, showed increased risk of CHD for all obesity measures. Further adjustment for metabolic mediators in the second model and time-varying variables in the third model produced negligible changes in the hazard ratios. The hazard ratios estimated by G-estimation were 1.15 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.83, 1.47) for general obesity, 1.65 (95\% CI: 1.35, 1.92) for AOB based on waist circumference, and 1.38 (95\% CI: 1.13, 1.99) for AOB based on waist:hip ratio, suggesting that AOB increased the risk of CHD. The G-estimated hazard ratios for both measures were further from the null than those derived from standard models.},

We describe the parametric g-formula, and use it to estimate the effect of various hypothetical lifestyle interventions on the risk of CHD using data from the Nurses' Health Study. Over the period 1982-2002, the 20-year risk of CHD in this cohort was 3.50\%. Under a joint intervention of no smoking, increased exercise, improved diet, moderate alcohol consumption and reduced body mass index, the estimated risk was 1.89\% (95\% confidence interval: 1.46-2.41). We discuss whether the assumptions required for the validity of the parametric g-formula hold in the Nurses' Health Study data.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 58,000 adults with type 2 diabetes and A1C {\textless}7\% (53 mmol/mol) while taking two or more oral agents or basal insulin had subsequent A1C {\textgreater}/=7\% (53 mmol/mol) to 8.5\% (69 mmol/mol). Follow-up started on date of first A1C {\textgreater}/=7\% and ended on date of a specific clinical event, death, disenrollment, or study end. Glucose-control strategies were defined as first intensification of glucose-lowering therapy at A1C {\textgreater}/=7, {\textgreater}/=7.5, {\textgreater}/=8, or {\textgreater}/=8.5\% with subsequent control for treatment adherence. Logistic marginal structural models were fitted to assess the discrete-time hazards for each dynamic glucose-control strategy, adjusting for baseline and time-dependent confounding and selection bias through inverse probability weighting. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, blood pressure, lipids, BMI, and other covariates, progressively more aggressive glucose-control strategies were associated with reduced onset or progression of albuminuria but not associated with significant reduction in occurrence of myocardial infarction or preserved renal function based on estimated glomerular filtration rate over 4 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In a large representative cohort of adults with type 2 diabetes, more aggressive glucose-control strategies have mixed short-term effects on microvascular complications and do not reduce the myocardial infarction rate over 4 years of follow-up. These findings are consistent with the results of recent clinical trials, but confirmation over longer periods of observation is needed.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Chronic disease care typically involves treatment decisions that are frequently adjusted to the patient's evolving clinical course (e.g., hemoglobin A1c monitoring and treatment intensification in diabetes patients). Thus, in comparative effectiveness and safety research (CER), it often is less clinically relevant to contrast the health effects of static treatment decisions than to compare the effectiveness of competing medical guidelines, that is, adaptive treatment strategies that map the patient's unfolding clinical course to subsequent treatment decisions. With longitudinal observational studies, treatment decisions at any point in time may be influenced by clinical factors that also are risk factors for the outcome of interest. Such time-dependent confounders cannot be properly handled with standard statistical approaches, because such confounders may be influenced by previous treatment decisions and may thus lie on causal pathways between the very outcomes and early treatment decisions whose effects are under study. Under explicit assumptions, we motivate the application of inverse probability weighting estimation to fit dynamic marginal structural models (MSMs) in observational studies to address pragmatic CER questions and properly adjust for time-dependent confounding and informative loss to follow-up. METHODS: We review the principles behind this modeling approach and describe its application in an observational study of type 2 diabetes patients to investigate the comparative effectiveness of four adaptive treatment intensification strategies for glucose control on subsequent development or progression of urinary albumin excretion. RESULTS: Results indicate a protective effect of more aggressive treatment intensification strategies in patients already on two or more oral agents or basal insulin. These conclusions are concordant with recent randomized trials. CONCLUSIONS: Inverse probability weighting estimation to fit dynamic MSM is a viable and appealing alternative to inadequate standard modeling approaches in many CER problems where time-dependent confounding and informative loss to follow-up are expected.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of the current study was to present and discuss a broad range of register-based definitions of chronic conditions for use in register research, as well as the challenges and pitfalls when defining chronic conditions by the use of registers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The definitions were defined based on information from nationwide Danish public healthcare registers. Medical and epidemiological specialists identified and grouped relevant diagnosis codes that covered chronic conditions, using the International Classification System version 10 (ICD-10). Where relevant, prescription and other healthcare data were also used to define the chronic conditions. RESULTS: We identified 199 chronic conditions and subgroups, which were divided into four groups according to a medical judgment of the expected duration of the conditions, as follows. Category I: Stationary to progressive conditions (maximum register inclusion time of diagnosis since the start of the register in 1994). Category II: Stationary to diminishing conditions (10 years of register inclusion after time of diagnosis). Category III: Diminishing conditions (5 years of register inclusion after time of diagnosis). Category IV: Borderline conditions (2 years of register inclusion time following diagnosis). The conditions were primarily defined using hospital discharge diagnoses; however, for 35 conditions, including common conditions such as diabetes, chronic obstructive lung disease and allergy, more complex definitions were proposed based on record linkage between multiple registers, including registers of prescribed drugs and use of general practitioners' services. CONCLUSIONS THIS STUDY PROVIDED A CATALOG OF REGISTER-BASED DEFINITIONS FOR CHRONIC CONDITIONS FOR USE IN HEALTHCARE PLANNING AND RESEARCH, WHICH IS, TO THE AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE, THE LARGEST CURRENTLY COMPILED IN A SINGLE STUDY.},

	abstract = {In comparative effectiveness research (CER), often the aim is to contrast survival outcomes between exposure groups defined by time-varying interventions. With observational data, standard regression analyses (e.g., Cox modeling) cannot account for time-dependent confounders on causal pathways between exposures and outcome nor for time-dependent selection bias that may arise from informative right censoring. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimation to fit marginal structural models (MSMs) has commonly been applied to properly adjust for these expected sources of bias in real-world observational studies. We describe the application and performance of an alternate estimation approach in such a study. The approach is based on the recently proposed targeted learning methodology and consists in targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) with super learning (SL) within a nonparametric MSM. The evaluation is based on the analysis of electronic health record data with both IPW estimation and TMLE to contrast cumulative risks under four more or less aggressive strategies for treatment intensification in adults with type 2 diabetes already on 2+ oral agents or basal insulin. Results from randomized experiments provide a surrogate gold standard to validate confounding and selection bias adjustment. Bootstrapping is used to validate analytic estimation of standard errors. This application does the following: (1) establishes the feasibility of TMLE in real-world CER based on large healthcare databases; (2) provides evidence of proper confounding and selection bias adjustment with TMLE and SL; and (3) motivates their application for improving estimation efficiency. Claims are reinforced with a simulation study that also illustrates the double-robustness property of TMLE.},

The package aims to provide a flexible tool for simplifying the conduct of transparent and reproducible simulation studies, with a particular emphasis on the types of data and interventions frequently encountered in real-world causal inference problems, such as, observational data with time-dependent confounding, selection bias, and random monitoring processes. The package interface allows for concise expression of complex functional dependencies between a large number of nodes, where each node may represent a measurement at a specific time point. The package allows for specification and simulation of counterfactual data under various user-specified interventions (e.g., static, dynamic, deterministic, or stochastic). In particular, the interventions may represent exposures to treatment regimens, the occurrence or non-occurrence of right-censoring events, or of clinical monitoring events. Finally, the package enables the computation of a selected set of user-specified features of the distribution of the counterfactual data that represent common causal quantities of interest, such as, treatment-specific means, the average treatment effects and coefficients from working marginal structural models. The applicability of simcausal is demonstrated by replicating the results of two published simulation studies.},

	abstract = {Background: Results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are usually accompanied by a table that compares covariates between the study groups at baseline. Sometimes, the investigators report p values for imbalanced covariates. The aim of this debate is to illustrate the pro and contra of the use of these p values in RCTs. Pro: Low p values can be a sign of biased or fraudulent randomization and can be used as a warning sign. They can be considered as a screening tool with low positive-predictive value. Low p values should prompt us to ask for the reasons and for potential consequences, especially in combination with hints of methodological problems. Contra: A fair randomization produces the expectation that the distribution of p values follows a flat distribution. It does not produce an expectation related to a single p value. The distribution of p values in RCTs can be influenced by the correlation among covariates, differential misclassification or differential mismeasurement of baseline covariates. Given only a small number of reported p values in the reports of RCTs, judging whether the realized p value distribution is, indeed, a flat distribution becomes difficult. If p values {\textless}/=0.005 or {\textgreater}/=0.995 were used as a sign of alarm, the false-positive rate would be 5.0\% if randomization was done correctly, and five p values per RCT were reported. Conclusion: Use of a low p value as a warning sign that randomization is potentially biased can be considered a vague heuristic. The authors of this debate are obviously more or less enthusiastic with this heuristic and differ in the consequences they propose.},

I show that the conditions usually cited in the literature are overly restrictive and can be relaxed substantially without compromising identification. In particular, I show that natural effects can be identified by methods that go beyond standard adjustment for confounders, applicable to observational studies in which treatment assignment remains confounded with the mediator or with the outcome. These identification conditions can be validated algorithmically from the diagrammatic description of one's model and are guaranteed to produce unbiased results whenever the description is correct. The identification conditions can be further relaxed in parametric models, possibly including interactions, and permit one to compare the relative importance of several pathways, mediated by interdependent variables.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Continuation of antiplatelet therapy beyond 12 months after a drug-eluting stent procedure reduced the risk of a major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) in the DAPT trial (Dual Antiplatelet Therapy). Observational studies have evaluated outcomes related to different durations of therapy but are susceptible to bias. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using deidentified claims from commercially insured and Medicare populations in the United States, we compared how increasingly stringent definitions of exposure affect associations between antiplatelet continuation versus discontinuation and MACCE, myocardial infarction, and intracerebral hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding in patients meeting DAPT trial inclusion criteria between 2004 and 2013. Therapy continuation at 12 months was defined as (1) having antiplatelet supply on hand versus not (landmark time); (2) refilling within 30 days versus not among individuals with antiplatelet supply; (3) criteria 2 plus continuous prior antiplatelet use; and (4) criteria 2 and 3 plus a cardiologist visit in months 10 to 12. Propensity score-adjusted hazard ratios were compared. Cohort sizes were 53 679, 27 524, 16 971, and 7948, respectively, of which 20\% were discontinuers on average. Increasing restriction led to progressively larger associations with continued treatment: cohort 1 MACCE hazard ratio, 0.79 (0.73, 0.87); myocardial infarction, 0.74 (0.65, 0.83); bleed, 1.03 (0.96, 1.11) versus cohort 4 MACCE hazard ratio, 0.66 (0.48, 0.91); myocardial infarction, 0.56 (0.37, 0.86); bleed, 1.24 (0.95, 1.61). Estimates trended toward DAPT trial estimates and were associated with reduced levels of exposure misclassification. CONCLUSIONS: In an example of long-term antiplatelet use, increasing restrictions on the definition of therapy continuation yielded results consistent with trial estimates by reducing exposure misclassification.},

	abstract = {The use of ADHD drugs among adults is controversial and has until recently not been approved for use in adults in most countries. The aim was to investigate use of ADHD drugs (stimulants and atomoxetine) among the entire adult population in the Nordic countries.
We conducted a multinational population-based prescription register study based on the entire adult population in the five Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden). All users of ADHD drugs aged 18-64 years during 2008-2012 were included, which for 2012 comprised 76,896 drug users among 15.8 million adult inhabitants.
Annual prevalence of drug use increased during the study period for both genders and all age groups. The overall prevalence increased from 2.4 to 5.3 per 1000 men and 1.8 to 4.4 per 1000 women. Incidence also increased, but to a lesser extent in the last part of the study period. Methylphenidate was used by 88 \% of drug users. Treatment was discontinued within the first year by 21 \% of new drug users. Among all users of ADHD drugs, 53 \% of men and 64 \% of women concurrently used other psychotropic drugs, most frequently antidepressants and hypnotics. Psychotropic co-medication increased with age and was more pronounced among women than men.
Use of ADHD drug among adults more than doubled over a 5-year period, and a majority were concurrently treated with other psychotropics. Adults constitute a substantial proportion of persons treated with ADHD drugs. Thus, evidence for long-term efficacy and safety in adults is urgently needed.},

We aimed to investigate whether younger age in class is associated with an increased probability of being prescribed medication for ADHD among school-aged children in Denmark. METHODS: We followed all Danish children between 2000 and 2012 from 1st through 6th grade (7-12 years). Among children who started school on their age-assigned grade level, we estimated the prevalence proportion ratio (PPR) of receiving ADHD medication between the youngest children in class (born in October-December) and the oldest in class (born in January-March), specified by grade level, calendar year and gender. As a sensitivity analysis, we added children not on their age-assigned grade level to the main calculations. RESULTS: We identified 932,032 eligible children for the main analysis, of whom 17.3\% were among the youngest and 26.5\% among the oldest in class. In total, 1.2\% eligible children filled at least one prescription for ADHD medication in 2000-2012. The average PPR over the study period was 1.08 (95\% CI, 1.04-1.12) and remained stable across subgroups and sensitivity analyses. Overall, 40\% of children born October-December had entered school a year after their age-assigned grade level. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to previous study results, we observed almost no relative age effect on medication use for ADHD among children in Denmark. We postulate that this may be due to the high proportion of relatively young children held back by 1 year in the Danish school system and/or a generally low prevalence of ADHD medication use in the country.},

ADHD drugs defined according to the World Health Organization Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical classification system as centrally acting sympathomimetics (N06BA). RESULTS: The 2007 prevalence of ADHD drug use among the total Nordic population was 2.76 per 1000 inhabitants, varying from 1.23 per 1000 in Finland to 12.46 per 1000 in Iceland. Adjusting for age, Icelanders were nearly five times more likely than Swedes to have used ADHD drugs (Prev.Ratio = 4.53, 95\% CI: 4.38-4.69). Prevalence among boys (age 7-15) was fourfold the prevalence among girls (Prev.Ratio = 4.28, 95\% CI: 3.70-4.96).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was developed to prevent infection with strains of HPV that cause cervical cancer. While HPV infection has been associated with reduced semen quality and lower pregnancy rates in some studies, no studies have examined the relationship between HPV vaccination and fecundability. We hypothesize that HPV prevention via vaccination will protect fecundity. METHODS: We analysed data from Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO), a preconception cohort of North American pregnancy planners. Between 2013 and 2017, we followed 3483 female pregnancy planners and 1022 of their male partners for 12 months or until reported pregnancy, whichever came first. At baseline, participants reported whether they had been vaccinated against HPV and their age at vaccination. We estimated fecundability ratios (FR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) using proportional probabilities models adjusted for sociodemographics, smoking, and abnormal Pap test before HPV vaccination (females only). RESULTS: HPV vaccination was more prevalent among females (33.9\%) than males (5.2\%). There was little overall association between female vaccination (FR 0.98, 95\% CI 0.90, 1.08) or male vaccination (FR 1.07, 95\% CI 0.79, 1.46) and fecundability. Among females with a history of sexually transmitted infections or pelvic inflammatory disease (i.e. a group at high risk of exposure to HPV infection), those vaccinated against HPV had higher fecundability than those not vaccinated (FR 1.35, 95\% CI 0.99, 1.86). CONCLUSION: Although HPV vaccination had little effect on fecundability overall, HPV vaccination was positively associated with fecundability among women with a history of sexually transmitted infections.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many children and adolescents with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are treated with stimulant and non-stimulant medication. ADHD medication may be associated with cardiovascular effects. It is important to identify whether mean group effects translate into clinically relevant increases for some individual patients, and/or increase the risk for serious cardiovascular adverse events such as stroke or sudden death. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate potential cardiovascular effects of these treatments, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of methylphenidate (MPH), amphetamines (AMP), and atomoxetine (ATX) on diastolic and systolic blood pressure (DBP, SBP) and heart rate (HR) in children and adolescents with ADHD. METHODS: We conducted systematic searches in electronic databases (PsychINFO, EMBASE and Medline) to identify published trials which involved individuals who were (i) diagnosed with ADHD and were aged between 0-18 years; (ii) treated with MPH, AMP or ATX and (iii) had their DBP and SBP and/or HR measured at baseline (pre) and the endpoint (post) of the study treatment. Studies with an open-label design or a double-blind randomised control design of any duration were included. Statistical analysis involved calculating differences between pre- and post-treatment measurements for the various cardiovascular parameters divided by the pooled standard deviation. Further, we assessed the percentage of clinically relevant increased BP or HR, or documented arrhythmias. RESULTS: Eighteen clinical trials met the inclusion criteria (10 for MPH, 5 for AMP, and 7 for ATX) with data from 5837 participants (80.7\% boys) and average duration of 28.7 weeks (range 4-96 weeks). All three medications were associated with a small, but statistically significant pre-post increase of SBP (MPH: standard mean difference [SMD] 0.25, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.08-0.42, p {\textless} 0.01; AMP: SMD 0.09, 95\% CI 0.03-0.15, p {\textless} 0.01; ATX: SMD 0.16, 95\% CI 0.04-0.27, p = 0.01). MPH did not have a pre-post effect on DBP and HR. AMP treatment was associated with a small but statistically significant pre-post increase of DBP (SMD 0.16, CI 0.03-0.29, p = 0.02), as was ATX treatment (SMD 0.22, CI 0.10-0.34, p {\textless} 0.01). AMP and ATX were associated with a small to medium statistically significant pre-post increase of HR (AMP: SMD 0.37, CI 0.13-0.60, p {\textless} 0.01; ATX: SMD 0.43, CI 0.26-0.60, p {\textless} 0.01). The head-to-head comparison of the three medications did not reveal significant differences. Sensitivity analyses revealed that AMP studies of {\textless}18 weeks reported higher effect sizes on DBP compared with longer duration studies (F(1) = 19.55, p = 0.05). Further, MPH studies published before 2007 reported higher effect sizes on SBP than studies after 2007 (F(1) = 5.346, p = 0.05). There was no effect of the following moderators: type of medication, doses, sample size, age, gender, type of ADHD, comorbidity or dropout rate. Participants on medication reported 737 (12.6\%) other cardiovascular effects. Notably, 2\% of patients discontinued their medication treatment due to any cardiovascular effect. However, in the majority of patients, the cardiovascular effects resolved spontaneously, medication doses were changed or the effects were not considered clinically relevant. There were no statistically significant differences between the medication treatments in terms of the severity of cardiovascular effects. CONCLUSIONS: Statistically significant pre-post increases of SBP, DBP and HR were associated with AMP and ATX treatment in children and adolescents with ADHD, while MPH treatment had a statistically significant effect only on SBP in these patients. These increases may be clinically significant for a significant minority of individuals that experience larger increases. Since increased BP and HR in general are considered risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality during adult life, paediatric patients using ADHD medication should be monitored closely and regularly for HR and BP.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the predictive accuracy of different methods suggested for approximation of drug prescription durations in claims data. METHODS: We expanded a well-established modeling and simulation framework to compare approximated drug prescription durations with 'true' (i.e., simulated) durations. Real claims data of persons aged {\textgreater}/=65 years insured by the German nationwide 'Statutory Health Insurance Fund' AOK between 2010 and 2012 provided empiric input parameters that were completed with missing information on actual dosing patterns from an observational cohort. The distinct approximation methods were based on crude measures (one tablet a day), population-averaged measures (defined daily doses), or individually-derived measures (longitudinal coverage approximation of the applied dose, COV). As a proof-of-principle, we assessed the methods' performance to predict the well-characterized bleeding risks of anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. RESULTS: When applied to modeling and simulation data sets, the closest, least biased, and thus most accurate approximation was observed using the COV approximation. In a real-data example, rather similar results to an external reference were obtained for all methods. However, some of the differences between methods were meaningful, and the most reasonable and consistent results were obtained with the COV approach. CONCLUSION: Based on theoretically most accurate approximations and practically reasonable estimates, the individual COV approach was preferable over the population-averaged defined daily dose technique, although the latter might be justified in certain situations. Advantages of the COV approach are expected to be even bigger for drug therapies with particularly large dosing heterogeneity. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12911-015-0140-z},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Databases of prescription drug purchases are now widely used in pharmacoepidemiologic studies. Several methods have been used to generate drug use periods from drug purchases to investigate various aspects; e.g., to study associations between exposure and outcome. Typically, such methods have been fairly simplistic, with fixed assumptions of drug use pattern and or dose (for example, the assumed usage of 1 tablet per day). This paper describes a novel PRE2DUP method that constructs drug use periods from purchase histories, and verified by a validation based on an expert evaluation of the drug use periods generated by the method. METHODS: The PRE2DUP method is a novel approach based on mathematical modelling of personal drug purchasing behaviors. The method uses a decision procedure that includes each person's purchase history for each ATC code, processed in a chronological order. The method constructs exposure time periods and estimates the dose used during the period by considering the purchased amount in Defined Daily Doses (DDDs), which is recorded in the prescription register database. This method takes account of stockpiling of drugs, personal purchasing pattern; i.e., regularity of the purchases, and periods of hospital or nursing home care where drug use is not recorded in the prescription register. The method can be applied to a variety of drug classes with different doses and use patterns by controlling restriction parameters for each ATC class, or even each drug package. In the presented example, the PRE2DUP method was applied to a register-based MEDALZ-2005 study cohort. All drug purchases (3,793,085) recorded in the Finnish prescription register between 2002 and 2009 for persons with Alzheimer's disease (28,093) were included. RESULTS: Results of the expert-opinion based validation indicate that PRE2DUP method creates drug use periods with a relatively high correctness. Drugs with varying patterns of use and drugs used on a short-term basis only require more precise parameters. CONCLUSIONS: PRE2DUP method gives highly accurate drug use periods for most drug classes, especially those meant for long-term use.},

It is based on the evaluation of personal drug purchasing patterns and considers hospital stays, possible stockpiling of drugs, and package information. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate person-level agreement between self-reported drug use in the interview and drug use modeled from dispensing data with PRE2DUP method for various drug classes used by older persons. METHODS: Self-reported drug use was assessed from the GeMS Study including a random sample of persons aged {\textgreater}/=75 years from the city of Kuopio, Finland, in 2006. Drug purchases recorded in the Prescription register data of these persons were modeled to determine drug use periods with PRE2DUP modeling method. Agreement between self-reported drug use on the interview date and drug use calculated from register-based data was compared in order to find the frequently used drugs and drug classes, which was evaluated by Cohen's kappa. Kappa values 0.61-0.80 were considered to represent good and 0.81-1.00 as very good agreement. RESULTS: Among 569 participants with mean age of 82 years, the agreement between interview and register data was very good for 75\% and very good or good for 93\% of the studied drugs or drug classes. Good or very good agreement was observed for drugs that are typically used on regular bases, whereas "as needed" drugs represented poorer results. CONCLUSION: PRE2DUP modeling method validly describes regular drug use among older persons. For most of drug classes investigated, PRE2DUP-modeled register data described drug use as well as interview-based data which are more time-consuming to collect. Further studies should be conducted by comparing it with other methods and in different drug user populations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In many prescription databases, the duration of treatment for the single prescription is not recorded. This study aimed to validate 2 different types of approaches for estimating prescription durations, using the oral anticoagulant warfarin as a case. METHODS: The approaches undergoing empirical validation covered assumptions of a fixed daily intake of either 0.5 or 1.0 defined daily dose (DDD), as well as estimates based on the reverse parametric waiting time distribution (rWTD), with different sets of covariates. We converted estimates of prescription duration to daily dose and compared them to prescribed daily dose as recorded in a clinical registry (using Bland-Altman plots). Methods were compared based on their average prediction error (logarithmic scale) and their limit of agreement ratio (ratio of mean error +/- 1.96 SD after transformation to original scale). RESULTS: Estimates of daily doses were underestimated by 19\% or overestimated by 62\% when assumptions of 0.5 or 1.0 DDD were applied. The limit of agreement ratio was 6.721 for both assumptions. The rWTD-based approaches performed better when using the estimated mean value of the inter-arrival density, yielding on average negligible bias (relative difference of 0 to 2\%) and with limit of agreement ratios decreasing upon additional covariate adjustment (from 6.857 with no adjustment to 4.036 with the fully adjusted model). CONCLUSIONS: Comparing the different methods, the rWTD algorithm performed best and led to unbiased estimates of prescribed doses and thus prescription durations and reduced misclassification on the individual level upon inclusion of covariates.},

	abstract = {The assessment of direct and indirect effects with time-varying mediators and confounders is a common but challenging problem, and standard mediation analysis approaches are generally not applicable in this context. The mediational g-formula was recently proposed to address this problem, paired with a semiparametric estimation approach to evaluate longitudinal mediation effects empirically. In this article, we develop a parametric estimation approach to the mediational g-formula, including a feasible algorithm implemented in a freely available SAS macro. In the Framingham Heart Study data, we apply this method to estimate the interventional analogues of natural direct and indirect effects of smoking behaviors sustained over a 10-year period on blood pressure when considering weight change as a time-varying mediator. Compared with not smoking, smoking 20 cigarettes per day for 10 years was estimated to increase blood pressure by 1.2 mm Hg (95\% CI: -0.7, 2.7). The direct effect was estimated to increase blood pressure by 1.5 mm Hg (95\% CI: -0.3, 2.9), and the indirect effect was -0.3 mm Hg (95\% CI: -0.5, -0.1), which is negative because smoking which is associated with lower weight is associated in turn with lower blood pressure. These results provide evidence that weight change in fact partially conceals the detrimental effects of cigarette smoking on blood pressure. Our study represents, to our knowledge, the first application of the parametric mediational g-formula in an epidemiologic cohort study (see video abstract at, http://links.lww.com/EDE/B159.).},

	abstract = {Ideally, randomized trials would be used to compare the long-term effectiveness of dynamic treatment regimes on clinically relevant outcomes. However, because randomized trials are not always feasible or timely, we often must rely on observational data to compare dynamic treatment regimes. An example of a dynamic treatment regime is "start combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) within 6 months of CD4 cell count first dropping below x cells/mm(3) or diagnosis of an AIDS-defining illness, whichever happens first" where x can take values between 200 and 500. Recently, Cain et al (2011) used inverse probability (IP) weighting of dynamic marginal structural models to find the x that minimizes 5-year mortality risk under similar dynamic regimes using observational data. Unlike standard methods, IP weighting can appropriately adjust for measured time-varying confounders (e.g., CD4 cell count, viral load) that are affected by prior treatment. Here we describe an alternative method to IP weighting for comparing the effectiveness of dynamic cART regimes: the parametric g-formula. The parametric g-formula naturally handles dynamic regimes and, like IP weighting, can appropriately adjust for measured time-varying confounders. However, estimators based on the parametric g-formula are more efficient than IP weighted estimators. This is often at the expense of more parametric assumptions. Here we describe how to use the parametric g-formula to estimate risk by the end of a user-specified follow-up period under dynamic treatment regimes. We describe an application of this method to answer the "when to start" question using data from the HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration.},

A recurrent problem in such analyses, however, is the overwhelming volume and complexity of data. We here describe a graphical approach that effectively conveys some essential utilization parameters for a drug.
The waiting time distribution for a group of drug users is a charting of their first prescription presentations within a specified time window. For a drug used for chronic treatment, most current users will be captured at the beginning of the window. After a few months, the graph will be dominated by new, Incident users. As examples, we present waiting time distributions for insulin, ulcer drugs, systemic corticosteroids, antidepressants, and disulfiram.
Appropriately analyzed and interpreted, the waiting time distributions can provide information about the period prevalence, point prevalence, incidence, duration of use, seasonality, and rate of prescription renewal or relapse for specific drugs. Each of these parameters has a visual correlate.
The waiting time distributions may be an informative supplement to conventional drug utilization statistics, and possibly also a useful screening tool for unusual prescribing patterns.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to develop and present a method to calculate which exposure duration should be assigned to single prescriptions for use in databases where information on expected duration is not recorded. METHODS: We propose a method, based on the waiting time distribution (WTD), which estimates how frequently prevalent users redeem new prescriptions. However, we added two steps to the WTD-approach. First, we excluded incident users, representing noise in the analysis. Second, we calculated the cumulative percentage of users that had presented themselves after a given number of days. Using a cutoff value of 80\%, we thus calculated the number of days for the majority of prevalent users to present themselves, that is, the exposure duration that should be assigned to the single prescription. The primary strength of the method is that it can be applied in a standardized fashion and that it does not require information on dosage instructions. The primary weakness of the method is that it is only usable on drugs with predominantly chronic use patterns. The method was tested using four model drugs: bendroflumethiazide, warfarin, levothyroxine, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). RESULTS: We found exposure period estimates of 92, 86, 69, and 210 days for bendroflumethiazide, levothyroxine, warfarin, and NSAIDs prescriptions, respectively. NSAIDs were found not to comply with the requirements of the method. The calculated number of exposed days was only slightly influenced by the assumptions of the method. CONCLUSIONS: The method provides a useful approach to generate automated estimates of exposure duration that should be assigned to each prescription.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To introduce the reverse waiting time distribution (WTD) and show how it can be used to estimate stopping fractions and real-time prevalence of treatment in pharmacoepidemiological studies. METHODS: The reverse WTD is the distribution of time from the last dispensed prescription of each patient within a time window to the end of it. It is a mirrored version of the ordinary WTD, which considers the first dispensed prescription of patients within a time window. Based on renewal process theory, the reverse WTD can be analyzed as an ordinary WTD with maximum likelihood estimation. Based on Danish prescription data for NSAIDs, warfarin, bendroflumethiazide and levothyroxine in the years 2013 and 2014, we compared estimates from the reverse WTD to those of the ordinary WTD regarding prevalence, stopping fractions and the 80th percentiles of the inter-arrival distributions. RESULTS: The fraction of all users in 2013 stopping treatment varied from 73.1\% (NSAID) to 9.3\% (levothyroxine). Comparing prevalence estimates of the reverse WTD at the end of 2013 with those of the ordinary WTD at the start of 2014, relative differences did not exceed 4.8\%. For the estimated 80th percentiles of the inter-arrival distribution, differences did not exceed 3.3\%. CONCLUSIONS: The reverse WTD allows estimation of the aggregated fraction of users stopping treatment and prevalence, especially when the WTD reliably separates current users from users who have stopped treatment. It may replace ad-hoc decision rules for automated implementations, and it yields estimates of real-time prevalence. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The study aimed to develop an automated method to estimate prescription durations in pharmacoepidemiological studies that may depend on patient and redemption characteristics. METHODS: We developed an estimation algorithm based on maximum likelihood estimation for the reverse waiting time distribution (WTD), which is the distribution of time from the last prescription of each patient within a time window to the end of the time window. The reverse WTD consists of two distinctly different components: one component for prevalent users and one for patients stopping treatment. We extended the model to allow parameters of the reverse WTD to depend on linear combinations of covariates to obtain estimates and confidence intervals for percentiles of the inter-arrival density (time from one prescription to the subsequent). We applied the method to redemptions of warfarin, using the amount of drug filled, patient sex and patient age as covariates. RESULTS: The estimated prescription durations increased with redeemed amount and age. Women generally had longer prescription durations, which increased more with age than men. For 70-year-old women redeeming 300+ pills, we predicted a 95th percentile of the inter-arrival density of 225 (95\%CI: 201, 249) days. For 50-year-old men redeeming 100 pills, the corresponding prediction was 97 (88, 106) days. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm allows estimation of prescription durations based on the reverse WTD, which can depend upon observed covariates. Statistical uncertainty intervals and tests allow statistical inference on the influence of observed patient and prescription characteristics. The method may replace ad hoc decision rules.

METHODS: We developed an estimation algorithm based on maximum likelihood estimation of a parametric two-component mixture model for the waiting time distribution (WTD). The distribution component for prevalent users estimates the forward recurrence density (FRD), which is related to the distribution of time between subsequent prescription redemptions, the inter-arrival density (IAD), for users in continued treatment. We exploited this to estimate percentiles of the IAD by inversion of the estimated FRD and defined the duration of a prescription as the time within which 80\% of current users will have presented themselves again. Statistical properties were examined in simulation studies, and the method was applied to empirical data for four model drugs: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), warfarin, bendroflumethiazide, and levothyroxine. RESULTS: Simulation studies found negligible bias when the data-generating model for the IAD coincided with the FRD used in the WTD estimation (Log-Normal). When the IAD consisted of a mixture of two Log-Normal distributions, but was analyzed with a single Log-Normal distribution, relative bias did not exceed 9\%. Using a Log-Normal FRD, we estimated prescription durations of 117, 91, 137, and 118 days for NSAIDs, warfarin, bendroflumethiazide, and levothyroxine, respectively. Similar results were found with a Weibull FRD. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm allows valid estimation of single prescription durations, especially when the WTD reliably separates current users from incident users, and may replace ad-hoc decision rules in automated implementations.

The aim of this study is to provide an overview and guidance on some of the available methodologies used to address problems related to time-varying exposure and confounding in pharmacoepidemiology and other observational studies. The methods are explored from a conceptual rather than an analytical perspective. METHODS: The methods described in this study have been identified exploring the literature concerning to the time-varying exposure concept and basing the search on four fundamental pharmacoepidemiological problems, construction of treatment episodes, time-varying confounders, cumulative exposure and latency, and treatment switching. RESULTS: A correct treatment episodes construction is fundamental to avoid bias in treatment effect estimates. Several methods exist to address time-varying covariates, but the complexity of the most advanced approaches-eg, marginal structural models or structural nested failure time models-and the lack of user-friendly statistical packages have prevented broader adoption of these methods. Consequently, simpler methods are most commonly used, including, for example, methods without any adjustment strategy and models with time-varying covariates. The magnitude of exposure needs to be considered and properly modelled. CONCLUSIONS: Further research on the application and implementation of the most complex methods is needed. Because different methods can lead to substantial differences in the treatment effect estimates, the application of several methods and comparison of the results is recommended. Treatment episodes estimation and exposure quantification are key parts in the estimation of treatment effects or associations of interest.},

Aim: We compared the following strategies for sampling comparison cohorts in matched cohort studies with respect to time to ischemic stroke and mortality: sampling without replacement in random order; sampling with replacement; and sampling without replacement in chronological order. Methods: We constructed index cohorts of individuals from the Danish general population with no particular trait, except being alive and without ischemic stroke on the index date. We also constructed index cohorts of persons aged {\textgreater}50 years from the general population. We then applied the sampling strategies to sample comparison cohorts (5:1 or 1:1) from the Danish general population and compared outcome risks between the index and comparison cohorts. Finally, we sampled comparison cohorts for a heart failure cohort using each strategy. Results: We observed increased outcome risks in comparison cohorts sampled 5:1 without replacement in random order compared to the index cohorts. However, these increases were minuscule unless index persons were aged {\textgreater}50 years. In this setting, sampling without replacement in chronological order failed to sample a sufficient number of comparators, and the mortality risks in these comparison cohorts were lower than in the index cohorts. Sampling 1:1 showed no systematic difference between comparison and index cohorts. When we sampled comparison cohorts for the heart failure patients, we observed a pattern similar to when index persons were aged {\textgreater}50 years. Conclusion: When index persons were aged {\textgreater}50 years, ie, had high outcome risks, sampling 5:1 without replacement introduced bias. Sampling with replacement or 1:1 did not introduce bias.},

However, the underlying effects on the neurotransmitter systems have not been comprehensively assessed. Objective: To investigate the association of early-life interference with different neurotransmitter systems by prenatal medication exposure on the risk of ASD in offspring. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case-control study included children born from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2007, and followed up for ASD until January 26, 2015, within a single Israeli health maintenance organization. Using publicly available data, 55 groups of medications affecting neurotransmitter systems and prescribed to pregnant women in this sample were identified. Children prenatally exposed to medications were compared with nonexposed children. Data were analyzed from March 1, 2017, through June 20, 2018. Main Outcome and Measures: Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% CIs of ASD risk associated with exposure to medication groups using Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for the relevant confounders (eg, birth year, maternal age, maternal history of psychiatric and neurologic disorders, or maternal number of all medical diagnoses 1 year before pregnancy). Results: The analytic sample consisted of 96249 individuals (1405 cases; 94844 controls; mean [SD] age at the end of follow-up, 11.6 [3.1] years; 48.8\% female), including 1405 with ASD and 94844 controls. Of 34 groups of medications, 5 showed nominally statistically significant association with ASD in fully adjusted models. Evidence of confounding effects of the number of maternal diagnoses on the association between offspring exposure to medication and ASD was found. Adjusting for this factor, lower estimates of ASD risk among children exposed to cannabinoid receptor agonists (HR, 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.55-0.95; P = .02), muscarinic receptor 2 agonists (HR, 0.49; 95\% CI, 0.24-0.98; P = .04), opioid receptor kappa and epsilon agonists (HR, 0.67; 95\% CI, 0.45-0.99; P = .045), or alpha2C-adrenergic receptor agonists (HR, 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.19-0.96; P = .04) were observed. Exposure to antagonists of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha was associated with higher estimates of ASD risk (HR, 12.94; 95\% CI, 1.35-124.25; P = .03). Conclusions and Relevance: Most of the medications affecting neurotransmitter systems in this sample had no association with the estimates of ASD risk.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the frequent use of self-controlled methods in pharmacoepidemiological studies, the factors that may bias the estimates from these methods have not been adequately compared in real-world settings. Here, we comparatively examined the impact of a time-varying confounder and its interactions with time-invariant confounders, time trends in exposures and events, restrictions, and misspecification of risk period durations on the estimators from three self-controlled methods. This study analyzed self-controlled case series (SCCS), case-crossover (CCO) design, and sequence symmetry analysis (SSA) using simulated and actual electronic medical records datasets. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of the three self-controlled methods in simulated cohorts for the following scenarios: 1) time-invariant confounding with interactions between the confounders, 2) time-invariant and time-varying confounding without interactions, 3) time-invariant and time-varying confounding with interactions among the confounders, 4) time trends in exposures and events, 5) restricted follow-up time based on event occurrence, and 6) patient restriction based on event history. The sensitivity of the estimators to misspecified risk period durations was also evaluated. As a case study, we applied these methods to evaluate the risk of macrolides on liver injury using electronic medical records. RESULTS: In the simulation analysis, time-varying confounding produced bias in the SCCS and CCO design estimates, which aggravated in the presence of interactions between the time-invariant and time-varying confounders. The SCCS estimates were biased by time trends in both exposures and events. Erroneously short risk periods introduced bias to the CCO design estimate, whereas erroneously long risk periods introduced bias to the estimates of all three methods. Restricting the follow-up time led to severe bias in the SSA estimates. The SCCS estimates were sensitive to patient restriction. The case study showed that although macrolide use was significantly associated with increased liver injury occurrence in all methods, the value of the estimates varied. CONCLUSIONS: The estimations of the three self-controlled methods depended on various underlying assumptions, and the violation of these assumptions may cause non-negligible bias in the resulting estimates. Pharmacoepidemiologists should select the appropriate self-controlled method based on how well the relevant key assumptions are satisfied with respect to the available data.},

In a case-crossover analysis, confounding by fixed (constant) characteristics is eliminated by pairing of cases to themselves, at the possible cost of introducing bias due to time trends in exposure. A case-time-control analysis can correct case-crossover results only for bias due to such time trends. If an uncontrolled confounder (such as disease severity) is present, the use of time controls can introduce new confounding, and the case-time-control results may end up either more or less confounded than the ordinary and case-crossover results. The relative confounding in the different approaches depends on details of the relations among the unmeasured confounder, the study exposure, the study disease, and any trend in these variables or their effects. Like an ordinary study, a case-time-control study must assume absence of unmeasured confounders, whether fixed or time-varying.

Although case-only designs use self-matching and only include individuals who develop the outcome of interest, issues of non-exchangeability are identical to those that arise in traditional case-control and cohort studies. In this review, we describe one type of case-only design, the case-crossover design, and discuss how the concept of exchangeability can be used to understand issues of confounding, carryover effects, period effects and selection bias in case-crossover studies.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Beryllium's classification as a carcinogen is based on limited human data that show inconsistent associations with lung cancer. Therefore, a thorough examination of those data is warranted. We reanalyzed data from the largest study of occupational beryllium exposure, conducted by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). METHODS: Data had been analyzed using stratification and standardization. We reviewed the strata in the original analysis, and reanalyzed using fewer strata. We also fit a Poisson regression, and analyzed simulated datasets that generated lung cancer cases randomly without regard to exposure. RESULTS: The strongest association reported in the NIOSH study, a standardized rate ratio for death from lung cancer of 3.68 for the highest versus lowest category of time since first employment, is affected by sparse-data bias, stemming from stratifying 545 lung cancer cases and their associated person-time into 1792 categories. For time since first employment, the measure of beryllium exposure with the strongest reported association with lung cancer, there were no strata without zeroes in at least one of the two contrasting exposure categories. Reanalysis using fewer strata or with regression models gave substantially smaller effect estimates. Simulations confirmed that the original stratified analysis was upwardly biased. Other metrics used in the NIOSH study found weaker associations and were less affected by sparse-data bias. CONCLUSIONS: The strongest association reported in the NIOSH study seems to be biased as a result of non-overlap of data across the numerous strata. Simulation results indicate that most of the effect reported in the NIOSH paper for time since first employment is attributable to sparse-data bias.},

	abstract = {The widespread use of 'statistical significance' as a license for making a claim of a scientific finding leads to considerable distortion of the scientific process (according to the American Statistical Association). We review why degrading p-values into 'significant' and 'nonsignificant' contributes to making studies irreproducible, or to making them seem irreproducible. A major problem is that we tend to take small p-values at face value, but mistrust results with larger p-values. In either case, p-values tell little about reliability of research, because they are hardly replicable even if an alternative hypothesis is true. Also significance (p≤0.05) is hardly replicable: at a good statistical power of 80\%, two studies will be 'conflicting', meaning that one is significant and the other is not, in one third of the cases if there is a true effect. A replication can therefore not be interpreted as having failed only because it is nonsignificant. Many apparent replication failures may thus reflect faulty judgment based on significance thresholds rather than a crisis of unreplicable research. Reliable conclusions on replicability and practical importance of a finding can only be drawn using cumulative evidence from multiple independent studies. However, applying significance thresholds makes cumulative knowledge unreliable. One reason is that with anything but ideal statistical power, significant effect sizes will be biased upwards. Interpreting inflated significant results while ignoring nonsignificant results will thus lead to wrong conclusions. But current incentives to hunt for significance lead to selective reporting and to publication bias against nonsignificant findings. Data dredging, p-hacking, and publication bias should be addressed by removing fixed significance thresholds. Consistent with the recommendations of the late Ronald Fisher, p-values should be interpreted as graded measures of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. Also larger p-values offer some evidence against the null hypothesis, and they cannot be interpreted as supporting the null hypothesis, falsely concluding that 'there is no effect'. Information on possible true effect sizes that are compatible with the data must be obtained from the point estimate, e.g., from a sample average, and from the interval estimate, such as a confidence interval. We review how confusion about interpretation of larger p-values can be traced back to historical disputes among the founders of modern statistics. We further discuss potential arguments against removing significance thresholds, for example that decision rules should rather be more stringent, that sample sizes could decrease, or that p-values should better be completely abandoned. We conclude that whatever method of statistical inference we use, dichotomous threshold thinking must give way to non-automated informed judgment.},

It is obligatory for each clinic to report each treatment cycle to the register, by means of special treatment report forms that contain clinical as well as laboratory data. The pregnancy outcome is reported on special forms no later than two months after birth. The personal identification number (CPR) allows cross-linkage of the data from the register, with several other national Danish registers, such as the National Hospital Register the Abortion Register, the Danish Register of Causes of Death, the Cytogenetic Central Register and the Cancer Register. In 1998 a total of 7131 IVF and ICSI cycles were performed in Denmark. This corresponds to around 6500 cycles per 1 million women in the reproductive age, which is among the highest number per capita in the world. The coverage of the register is believed to be very close to 100\% for the treatment reports, but less for the pregnancy outcome forms, at least during the first two years after the register was established.

	doi = {10.1093/humrep/dey309},
	abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Does inverse probability weighting (IPW) provide a more valid estimate of the cumulative incidence of live birth after multiple cycles of IVF? SUMMARY ANSWER: IPW can provide a more accurate estimate of treatment success for counseling and decision-making regarding IVF. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Different approaches have been used to define and calculate IVF success; however, many of these approaches have limitations and potentially violate statistical assumptions. IPW can address potential selection bias that arises when people do not continue IVF treatment after a failed cycle. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Data were derived from a cohort study of women undergoing their first fresh embryo transfer IVF cycle at our institution between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2014. All autologous cycles (fresh and frozen) were included, up to six total cycles. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We identified 20 015 women who underwent 47 079 IVF cycles and had 10 031 live births during the study period. The cumulative incidence of live birth was calculated using three approaches. First, we used a standard Kaplan-Meier approach, 'the optimistic approach', censoring women when they dropped out of treatment. Second, we used a 'conservative' Kaplan-Meier approach that assumed women who dropped out of treatment did not achieve a live birth. Finally, we used IPW to calculate the probability of remaining in treatment, while accounting for differences in treatment drop out. IPW up-weights the data of those remaining under observation who resembled the women who dropped out of treatment, thereby decreasing the potential selection bias resulting from loss to follow-up. The IPW was incorporated into a Kaplan-Meier approach. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The cumulative incidence of live birth was 72.1\% (95\% CI: 71.0-73.1\%) for the optimistic approach, 50.1\% (49.4-50.8\%) for the conservative approach and 66.8\% (65.5-68.1\%) for the IPW approach. Among women {\textless} 38 years of age, the cumulative incidence of live birth calculated by the IPW was slightly higher than that calculated by the optimistic approach. For women 41-42 years of age, the IPW cumulative incidence of live birth was slightly lower. The IPW was similar to the optimistic approach for the other age groups. The conservative estimate was lowest for all age groups. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Only clinical data recorded by the providers during an IVF cycle were used to generate weights for IPW. Covariates included: age, gravidity and year at the start of the cycle; primary infertility diagnosis; procedure type (i.e. whether a fresh or frozen embryo was transferred); number of mature oocytes retrieved; number of embryos transferred; cycle cancellation; pregnancy loss in the cycle; and insurance status. We were unable to determine exact reasons for treatment drop out (e.g. cessation of IVF treatment, transfer to another institution or spontaneous pregnancy). Our IPW model was moderately predictive based on the c-statistic from the calculation of the denominator of the weight; however, residual selection bias may remain due to the limited range of covariate data. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: IPW can be used in a variety of settings to address selection bias introduced by differential loss to follow up or treatment drop out.

Each observation is weighted by its inverse probability of being in a certain group. The AKME is shown to be a consistent estimate of the survival function, and the variance of the AKME is derived. A weighted log-rank test is proposed for comparing group differences of survival functions. Simulation studies are used to illustrate the performance of AKME and the weighted log-rank test. The method proposed here outperforms the Kaplan-Meier estimate, and it does better than or as well as other estimators based on stratification. The AKME and the weighted log-rank test are applied to two real examples: one is the study of times to reinfection of sexually transmitted diseases, and the other is the primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) study.},

We examined the association between oseltamivir use during pregnancy and birth outcomes. METHODS: This was a nationwide registry-based prevalence study with individual level data linkage, in a setting of universal health care access. We included all recorded pregnancies in Denmark in 2002-2013, and used data from population registries to examine associations between dispensings for oseltamivir during pregnancy (first trimester, second/third trimester, none) and congenital malformations, foetal death, preterm birth, foetal growth, and low 5-min Apgar score. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using propensity score matching. RESULTS: The study included 946,176 pregnancies. Of these, 449 had first-trimester exposure and 1449 had second/third-trimester exposure to oseltamivir. Adjusted ORs following first-trimester exposure were 0.94 (95\% CI 0.49 to 1.83) for any major congenital malformation and 1.75 (95\% CI 0.51 to 5.98) for congenital heart defects, based on 7 exposed cases. The association with congenital heart defects was present for etiologically implausible exposure periods and for known safe exposures. There was no evidence of an association between prenatal exposure to oseltamivir and any of the other birth outcomes assessed.

Focusing efforts on women with postmenopausal bleeding (PMB), a common symptom of endometrial cancer, may be a useful strategy; however, PMB is not specific for endometrial cancer and is often caused by benign conditions. Objective: To provide a reference of the prevalence of PMB in endometrial cancers and the risk of endometrial cancer in women with PMB. Data Sources: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed and Embase were searched for English-language studies published January 1, 1977, through January 31, 2017. Study Selection: Observational studies reporting the prevalence of PMB in women with endometrial cancer and the risk of endometrial cancer in women with PMB in unselected populations were selected. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two independent reviewers evaluated study quality and risk of bias using items from the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. Studies that included highly selected populations, lacked detailed inclusion criteria, and/or included 25 or fewer women were excluded. Main Outcomes and Measures: The pooled prevalence of PMB in women with endometrial cancer and the risk of endometrial cancer in women with PMB. Results: A total of 129 unique studies, including 34432 unique patients with PMB and 6358 with endometrial cancer (40790 women), were analyzed. The pooled prevalence of PMB among women with endometrial cancer was 91\% (95\% CI, 87\%-93\%), irrespective of tumor stage. The pooled risk of endometrial cancer among women with PMB was 9\% (95\% CI, 8\%-11\%), with estimates varying by use of hormone therapy (range, 7\% [95\% CI, 6\%-9\%] to 12\% [95\% CI, 9\%-15\%]; P {\textless} .001 for heterogeneity) and geographic region (range, 5\% [95\% CI, 3\%-11\%] in North America to 13\% [95\% CI, 9\%-19\%] in Western Europe; P = .09 for heterogeneity). Conclusions and Relevance: Early detection strategies focused on women with PMB have the potential to capture as many as 90\% of endometrial cancers; however, most women with PMB will not be diagnosed with endometrial cancer. These results can aid in the assessment of the potential clinical value of new early detection markers and clinical management strategies for endometrial cancer and will help to inform clinical and epidemiologic risk prediction models to support decision making.},

Results: Of 3577 women with hypertensive pregnancies in the Nordic cohort and 14 900 in the U.S. cohort, 682 (19.1\%) and 1668 (11.2\%), respectively, were exposed to beta-blockers in the first trimester. The pooled adjusted relative risk (RR) and risk difference per 1000 persons exposed (RD1000) associated with beta-blockers were 1.07 (95\% CI, 0.89 to 1.30) and 3.0 (CI, -6.6 to 12.6), respectively, for any major malformation; 1.12 (CI, 0.83 to 1.51) and 2.1 (CI, -4.3 to 8.4) for any cardiac malformation; and 1.97 (CI, 0.74 to 5.25) and 1.0 (CI, -0.9 to 3.0) for cleft lip or palate. For CNS malformations, the adjusted RR was 1.37 (CI, 0.58 to 3.25) and the RD1000 was 1.0 (CI, -2.0 to 4.0) (based on U.S. cohort data only). Limitation: Analysis was restricted to live births, exposure was based on dispensed medication, and cleft lip or palate and CNS malformations had few outcomes. Conclusion: The results suggest that maternal use of beta-blockers in the first trimester is not associated with a large increase in the risk for overall malformations or cardiac malformations, independent of measured confounders.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the ability of the propensity score (PS) to reduce confounding bias in the presence of nondifferential misclassification of treatment, using simulations. METHODS: Using an example from the pregnancy medication safety literature, we carried out simulations to quantify the effect of nondifferential misclassification of treatment under varying scenarios of sensitivity and specificity, exposure prevalence (10\%, 50\%), outcome type (continuous and binary), true outcome (null and increased risk), confounding direction, and different PS applications (matching, stratification, weighting, regression), and obtained measures of bias and 95\% confidence interval coverage. RESULTS: All methods were subject to substantial bias toward the null due to nondifferential exposure misclassification (range: 0\%-47\% for 50\% exposure prevalence and 0\%-80\% for 10\% exposure prevalence), particularly if specificity was low ({\textless}97\%). PS stratification produced the least biased effect estimates. We observed that the impact of sensitivity and specificity on the bias and coverage for each adjustment method is strongly related to prevalence of exposure: as exposure prevalence decreases and/or outcomes are continuous rather than categorical, the effect of misclassification is magnified, producing larger biases and loss of coverage of 95\% confidence intervals. PS matching resulted in unpredictably biased effect estimates. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study underline the importance of assessing exposure misclassification in observational studies in the context of PS methods. Although PS methods reduce confounding bias, bias owing to nondifferential misclassification is of potentially greater concern.},

This guideline focuses on the management of VTE and thrombophilia as well as the use of antithrombotic agents during pregnancy. METHODS: The methods of this guideline follow the Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines in this supplement. RESULTS: We recommend low-molecular-weight heparin for the prevention and treatment of VTE in pregnant women instead of unfractionated heparin (Grade 1B). For pregnant women with acute VTE, we suggest that anticoagulants be continued for at least 6 weeks postpartum (for a minimum duration of therapy of 3 months) compared with shorter durations of treatment (Grade 2C). For women who fulfill the laboratory criteria for antiphospholipid antibody (APLA) syndrome and meet the clinical APLA criteria based on a history of three or more pregnancy losses, we recommend antepartum administration of prophylactic or intermediate-dose unfractionated heparin or prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin combined with low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg/d) over no treatment (Grade 1B). For women with inherited thrombophilia and a history of pregnancy complications, we suggest not to use antithrombotic prophylaxis (Grade 2C). For women with two or more miscarriages but without APLA or thrombophilia, we recommend against antithrombotic prophylaxis (Grade 1B). CONCLUSIONS: Most recommendations in this guideline are based on observational studies and extrapolation from other populations. There is an urgent need for appropriately designed studies in this population.},

In this study, we examined the annual prevalence of prescription users and amount of use of systemic GCs. DESIGN: Population-wide prevalence study. SETTING: The primary healthcare and hospital sectors in Denmark from 1999 to 2015. RESULTS: Approximately 3\% of the Danish population redeemed at least one prescription for a systemic GC annually between 1999 and 2015, with annual prevalence remaining constant over the period. However, after adjusting for age and sex, we observed a decrease in annual prevalence from 1999 to 2015, with a prevalence ratio of 0.92 (95\% CI 0.91 to 0.92). Annual prevalence was highest among the elderly (7.0\%-8.2\% among persons 65-79 years of age and 8.4\%-10\% among persons 80+ years of age). Prednisolone was the most frequently redeemed systemic GC, with annual prevalence increasing from 1.4\% to 2.1\% during the 1999-2015 period. The amount of systemic GCs provided to the hospital sector increased from 2.3 defined daily doses (DDD)/1000 inhabitants/day in 1999 to 3.5 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day in 2015, while the amount provided to the primary healthcare sector remained constant in the range of 10-11 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day. CONCLUSION: We found a high prevalence of systemic GC use of 3\% with a remarkably high prevalence in elderly of up to 10\%, wherefore continued awareness of its effects is mandated.},

However, the emergence of CVD risk factors after HDP is less well-understood. Objective: To identify associations between HDP and maternal CVD risk factors and chart the trajectory of risk factor development after pregnancy. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: United States. Participants: 58 671 parous NHS II (Nurses' Health Study II) participants who did not have CVD or risk factors of interest at baseline. Measurements: Women were followed for self-reported physician diagnosis of chronic hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and confirmed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from their first birth through 2013; mean follow-up ranged from 25 to 32 years across these end points. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% CIs, with adjustment for prepregnancy confounders. Results: Compared with women who were normotensive during pregnancy, those with gestational hypertension (2.9\%) or preeclampsia (6.3\%) in their first pregnancy had increased rates of chronic hypertension (HRs, 2.8 [95\% CI, 2.6 to 3.0] and 2.2 [CI, 2.1 to 2.3], respectively), T2DM (HRs, 1.7 [CI, 1.4 to 1.9] and 1.8 [CI, 1.6 to 1.9], respectively), and hypercholesterolemia (HRs, 1.4 [CI, 1.3 to 1.5] and 1.3 [CI, 1.3 to 1.4], respectively). Although these women were more likely to develop CVD risk factors throughout follow-up, the relative risk for chronic hypertension was strongest within 5 years after their first birth. Recurrence of HDP further elevated risks for all end points. Limitation: Participants self-reported HDP. Conclusion: Women with HDP in their first pregnancy had increased rates of chronic hypertension, T2DM, and hypercholesterolemia that persisted for several decades.

A new measure of variability, the ratio of overall prevalence to time-window-specific prevalence, is introduced. The higher the overall:time window (OTW) ratio, the greater the potential for misclassification when using anytime-during-pregnancy prevalence for an agent that exerts its effect in a smaller time window, Exposures to cigarettes, marijuana, saunas/hot tubs, factors related to location of residence, and some workplace substances tended to be of longer duration, Intertrimester concordance was high (kappa's {\textgreater} 0.8) for smoking, residential proximity to crops, and use of video display terminals; moderately high (kappa's between 0.4 and 0.8) for many occupational exposures; and low (kappa's {\textless} 0.4) for illnesses, which tended to be of short duration, The lowest OTW ratios were for smoking and some residential exposures (1.1-1.3), while OTW ratios were much higher for paint applications, influenza, vaginal infections, and ultrasound (reaching, e.g., 4-6), Use of anytime-during-pregnancy exposure indices can bias measures of association between risk factors and adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly if the OTW ratio is high, Misclassification bias occurs if there is a vulnerable time window during which the exposure exerts its effect. The misclassification can be differential when the average length of gestation of cases is shorter than that of controls.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of decongestants during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy has been associated with a decreased risk of preterm delivery in two observational studies. This effect may have been subject to immortal time bias, a bias arising from the improper classification of exposure during follow-up. We illustrate this bias by repeating the studies using a different data source. METHODS: The United Kingdom Hospital Episodes Statistics and the Clinical Practice Research Datalink databases were linked to identify all live singleton pregnancies among women aged 15 to 45 years between 1997 and 2012. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals of preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation) by considering the use of decongestants during the third trimester as a time-fixed (biased analysis which misclassifies unexposed person-time as exposed person-time) and time-varying exposure (unbiased analysis with proper classification of unexposed person-time). All models were adjusted for maternal age, smoking status, maternal diabetes, maternal hypertension, preeclampsia, and parity. RESULTS: Of the 195,582 singleton deliveries, 10,248 (5.2\%) were born preterm. In the time-fixed analysis, the HR of preterm delivery for the use of decongestants was below the null and suggestive of a 46\% decreased risk (adjusted HR = 0.54; 95\% confidence interval, 0.24-1.20). In contrast, the HR was closer to null (adjusted HR = 0.93 95\% confidence interval, 0.42-2.06) when the use of decongestants was treated as a time-varying variable. CONCLUSION: Studies of drug safety in pregnancy should use the appropriate statistical techniques to avoid immortal time bias, particularly when the exposure occurs at later stages of pregnancy.},

DESIGN: Nationwide population based cohort study using medical registries. SETTING: All hospitals in Denmark. SUBJECTS: 234,331 patients with a first time hospitalisation for myocardial infarction from 1984 through 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardised incidence rate of myocardial infarction and 30 day and 31-365 day mortality by sex. Comorbidity categories were defined as normal, moderate, severe, and very severe according to the Charlson comorbidity index, and were compared by means of mortality rate ratios based on Cox regression. RESULTS: The standardised incidence rate per 100,000 people decreased in the 25 year period by 37\% for women (from 209 to 131) and by 48\% for men (from 410 to 213). The 30 day, 31-365 day, and one year mortality declined from 31.4\%, 15.6\%, and 42.1\% in 1984-8 to 14.8\%, 11.1\%, and 24.2\% in 2004-8, respectively. After adjustment for age at time of myocardial infarction, men and women had the same one year risk of dying. The mortality reduction was independent of comorbidity category. Comparing patients with very severe versus normal comorbidity during 2004-8, the mortality rate ratio, adjusted for age and sex, was 1.96 (95\% CI 1.83 to 2.11) within 30 days and 3.89 (3.58 to 4.24) within 31-365 days. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of first time hospitalisation for myocardial infarction and subsequent short term mortality both declined by nearly half between 1984 and 2008. The reduction in mortality occurred for all patients, independent of sex and comorbidity. However, comorbidity burden was a strong prognostic factor for short and long term mortality, while sex was not.},

The paper begins with an introduction to measures of causal effects within the potential-outcomes framework, focusing on underlying conceptual models, definitions and drawbacks of special relevance to policy formulation based on epidemiologic data. It is argued that, for policy purposes, one should analyze intervention effects within a multivariate-outcome framework to capture the impact of major sources of morbidity and mortality. This framework can clarify what is captured and missed by summary measures of population health, and shows that the concept of summary measure can and should be extended to multidimensional indices.},

	abstract = {Only 60-70\% of fertilized eggs may result in a live birth, and very early fetal loss mainly goes unnoticed. Outcomes that can only be ascertained in live-born children will be missing for those who do not survive till birth. In this article, we illustrate a common bias structure (leading to 'live-birth bias') that arises from studying the effects of prenatal exposure to environmental factors on long-term health outcomes among live births only in pregnancy cohorts. To illustrate this we used prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in school-aged children as an example. PFAS are persistent organic pollutants that may impact human fecundity and be toxic for neurodevelopment. We simulated several hypothetical scenarios based on characteristics from the Danish National Birth Cohort and found that a weak inverse association may appear even if PFAS do not cause ADHD but have a considerable effect on fetal survival. The magnitude of the negative bias was generally small, and adjusting for common causes of the outcome and fetal loss can reduce the bias. Our example highlights the need to identify the determinants of pregnancy loss and the importance of quantifying bias arising from conditioning on live birth in observational studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies have consistently shown that pregnancy smoking is associated with twice the risk of hyperactivity/inattention problems in the offspring. An association of this magnitude may indicate behavioural difficulties as one of the most important health effects related to smoking during pregnancy. However, social and genetic confounders may fully or partially account for these findings. METHODS: A cohort including all singletons born in Finland from 1 January 1987 through 31 December 2001 was followed until 1 January 2006 based on linkage of national registers. Data were available for 97\% (N = 868,449) of the population. We followed singleton children of smoking and non-smoking mothers until they had an International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder (HKD) or to the end of the observation period. We used sibling-matched Cox regression analyses to control for social and genetic confounding. RESULTS: We found a much smaller association between exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy and risk of HKD in children using the sibling-matched analysis [hazards ratio (HR) = 1.20, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-1.49] than was observed in the entire cohort (HR 2.01, 95\% CI 1.90-2.12). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the strong association found in previous studies may be due to time-stable familial factors, such as environmental and genetic factors. If smoking is a causal factor, the effect is small and less important than what the previous studies indicate.},

Here, the authors illustrate use of time on treatment as an alternative time scale. In addition, a method is provided for estimating Kaplan-Meier-type survival curves for marginal structural models. For illustration, the authors estimate the total effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy on time to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or death in 1,498 US men and women infected with human immunodeficiency virus and followed for 6,556 person-years between 1995 and 2002; 323 incident cases of clinical AIDS and 59 deaths occurred. Of the remaining 1,116 participants, 77\% were still under observation at the end of follow-up. By using time on study, the hazard ratio for AIDS or death comparing always with never using highly active antiretroviral therapy from the marginal structural model was 0.52 (95\% confidence interval: 0.35, 0.76). By using time on treatment, the analogous hazard ratio was 0.44 (95\% confidence interval: 0.32, 0.60). In time-to-event analyses, the choice of time scale may have a meaningful impact on estimates of association and precision. In the present example, use of time on treatment yielded a hazard ratio further from the null and more precise than use of time on study as the time scale.},

Methods that correctly adjust for this type of covariate include the parametric g-formula, inverse probability weighted estimation of marginal structural Cox proportional hazards models, and g-estimation of structural nested accelerated failure time models. In this article, we propose a novel method to estimate the causal effect of a time-dependent treatment on failure in the presence of informative right-censoring and time-dependent confounders that may be affected by past treatment: g-estimation of structural nested cumulative failure time models (SNCFTMs). An SNCFTM considers the conditional effect of a final treatment at time m on the outcome at each later time k by modeling the ratio of two counterfactual cumulative risks at time k under treatment regimes that differ only at time m. Inverse probability weights are used to adjust for informative censoring. We also present a procedure that, under certain "no-interaction" conditions, uses the g-estimates of the model parameters to calculate unconditional cumulative risks under nondynamic (static) treatment regimes. The procedure is illustrated with an example using data from a longitudinal cohort study, in which the "treatments" are healthy behaviors and the outcome is coronary heart disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Due to time-dependent confounding by blood pressure and differential loss to follow-up, it is difficult to estimate the effectiveness of aggressive versus conventional antihypertensive combination therapies in non-randomized comparisons. METHODS: We utilized data from 22,576 hypertensive coronary artery disease patients, prospectively enrolled in the INternational VErapamil-Trandolapril STudy (INVEST). Our post-hoc analyses did not consider the randomized treatment strategies, but instead defined exposure time-dependently as aggressive treatment ({\textgreater}/=3 concomitantly used antihypertensive medications) versus conventional treatment ({\textless}/=2 concomitantly used antihypertensive medications). Study outcome was defined as time to first serious cardiovascular event (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or all-cause death). We compared hazard ratio (HR) estimates for aggressive vs. conventional treatment from a Marginal Structural Cox Model (MSCM) to estimates from a standard Cox model. Both models included exposure to antihypertensive treatment at each follow-up visit, demographics, and baseline cardiovascular risk factors, including blood pressure. The MSCM further adjusted for systolic blood pressure at each follow-up visit, through inverse probability of treatment weights. RESULTS: 2,269 (10.1\%) patients experienced a cardiovascular event over a total follow-up of 60,939 person-years. The HR for aggressive treatment estimated by the standard Cox model was 0.96 (95\% confidence interval 0.87-1.07). The equivalent MSCM, which was able to account for changes in systolic blood pressure during follow-up, estimated a HR of 0.81 (95\% CI 0.71-0.92). CONCLUSIONS: Using a MSCM, aggressive treatment was associated with a lower risk for serious cardiovascular outcomes compared to conventional treatment. In contrast, a standard Cox model estimated similar risks for aggressive and conventional treatments. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00133692.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Maternal psychiatric disease is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy has been associated with congenital anomalies, neonatal withdrawal syndrome, and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. However, the risk of stillbirth and infant mortality when accounting for previous maternal psychiatric disease remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To study risk of stillbirth and infant mortality associated with use of SSRIs during pregnancy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based cohort study from all Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) at different periods from 1996 through 2007. The study included women with singleton births. We obtained information on maternal use of SSRIs from prescription registries. Maternal characteristics, pregnancy, and neonatal outcomes were obtained from patient and medical birth registries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We used logistic regression to estimate relative risks of stillbirth, neonatal death, and postneonatal death associated with SSRI use during pregnancy taking into account maternal characteristics and previous psychiatric hospitalization. RESULTS: Among 1,633,877 singleton births in the study, 6054 were stillbirths; 3609, neonatal deaths; and 1578, postneonatal deaths. A total of 29,228 (1.79\%) of mothers had filled a prescription for an SSRI during pregnancy. Women exposed to an SSRI presented with higher rates of stillbirth (4.62 vs 3.69 per 1000, P = .01) and postneonatal death (1.38 vs 0.96 per 1000, P = .03) than those who did not. The rate of neonatal death was similar between groups (2.54 vs 2.21 per 1000, P = .24). Yet in multivariable models, SSRI use was not associated with stillbirth (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.17; 95\% CI, 0.96-1.41; P = .12), neonatal death (adjusted OR, 1.23; 95\% CI, 0.96-1.57; P = .11), or postneonatal death (adjusted OR, 1.34; 95\% CI, 0.97-1.86; P = .08). Estimates were further attenuated when stratified by previous hospitalization for psychiatric disease. The adjusted OR for stillbirth in women with a previous hospitalization for psychiatric disease was 0.92 (95\% CI, 0.66-1.28; P = .62) and was 1.07 (95\% CI, 0.84-1.36; P = .59) for those who had not been previously hospitalized. The corresponding ORs for neonatal death were 0.89 (95\% CI, 0.58-1.39; P = .62) for women who were hospitalized and 1.14 (95\% CI, 0.84-1.56; P = .39) for women who were not. For postneonatal death, the ORs were 1.02 (95\% CI, 0.61-1.69; P = .95) for women who were hospitalized and 1.10 (95\% CI, 0.71-1.72; P = .66) for women who were not. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among women with singleton births in Nordic countries, no significant association was found between use of SSRIs during pregnancy and risk of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, or postneonatal mortality. However, decisions about use of SSRIs during pregnancy must take into account other perinatal outcomes and the risks associated with maternal mental illness.},

A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so-and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.},

	abstract = {Statistical methods play a pivotal role in health risk assessment, but not always an enlightened one. Problems well known to academics are frequently overlooked in crucial nonacademic venues such as litigation, even though those venues can have profound impacts on population health and medical practice. Statisticians have focused heavily on how statistical significance overstates evidence against null hypotheses, but less on how statistical nonsignificance does not correspond to evidence for the null. I thus present an example of a highly credentialed statistical expert conflating high "nonsignificance" with strong support for the null, via misinterpretation of a P-value as a posterior probability of the null hypothesis. Reverse-Bayes analyses reveal that nearly all the support for the null claimed by the expert must have come from the expert's prior, rather than the data, there being no background data that could support a strong prior. The example illustrates how inattention to the actual meaning of P-values and confidence limits allow extremely biased prior opinions (including null-spiked opinions) to be presented as if they were objective inferences from the data.},

To deal with this inescapable reality, we need to replace vague and unattainable calls for objectivity with more precise operational qualities.

Conformity of researchers to these qualities may be evaluated by considering whether their reports disclose key information desired by readers and whether their methodology encourages initial neutrality among hypotheses of concern. A case study is given in which two authors appearing to share these values and writing on ostensibly the same issues (disclosure and methodology) nonetheless appear to have very different concepts of what the values entail in practice. Thus, more precision is needed in explicating and implementing such values.},

This problem arises via selective choice of parameters at which power is calculated, but can also arise if one computes power at a prespecified alternative. As noted by earlier authors, power computed using sample estimates ("observed power") replaces this problem with even more counterintuitive behavior, because observed power effectively double counts the data and increases as the P value declines. Use of power to analyze and interpret data thus needs more extensive discouragement.},

Human factors have expanded what might otherwise have been narrow technical discussions into broad philosophical debates. There seem to be misconceptions about the requirements and capabilities of formal methods, especially in notions that certain assumptions or models (such as potential-outcome models) are necessary or sufficient for valid inference. I argue that, once these misconceptions are removed, most elements of the opposing views can be reconciled. The chief problem of causal inference then becomes one of how to teach sound use of formal methods (such as causal modeling, statistical inference, and sensitivity analysis), and how to apply them without generating the overconfidence and misinterpretations that have ruined so many statistical practices.},

Unfortunately, reducing the type I error for null associations increases the type II error for those associations that are not null. The theoretical basis for advocating a routine adjustment for multiple comparisons is the "universal null hypothesis" that "chance" serves as the first-order explanation for observed phenomena. This hypothesis undermines the basic premises of empirical research, which holds that nature follows regular laws that may be studied through observations. A policy of not making adjustments for multiple comparisons is preferable because it will lead to fewer errors of interpretation when the data under evaluation are not random numbers but actual observations on nature. Furthermore, scientists should not be so reluctant to explore leads that may turn out to be wrong that they penalize themselves by missing possibly important findings.},

Philosophers agree that causal propositions cannot be proved, and find flaws or practical limitations in all philosophies of causal inference. Hence, the role of logic, belief, and observation in evaluating causal propositions is not settled. Causal inference in epidemiology is better viewed as an exercise in measurement of an effect rather than as a criterion-guided process for deciding whether an effect is present or not.},

A case-control study observes the population more efficiently by using a sample of the population, which becomes the control series, in place of complete assessment of the denominators of the disease frequencies. This extra sampling step can make a case-control study much more efficient than a cohort study of the same population, but it introduces a number of subtleties and avenues for bias that are absent in typical cohort studies. For diseases that are sufficiently rare, cohort studies become impractical, and case-control studies become the only useful alternative. The cases in a case-control study should be the same people who would be considered cases in a cohort study of the same population. The definition of the source population for these cases determines the population from which controls should be sampled. Ideally, control selection would involve direct sampling from the source population, with equal probability of selection, although in many circumstances, variations in and substitutes for this ideal sampling design may be considered.},

This issue has been related to prominent cases of data fabrication and survey results pointing to bad practices in empirical science. Although we concur with the motives behind these critical arguments, we note that an isolated debate of false positives may itself be misleading and counter-productive. Instead, we argue that, given the current state of affairs in behavioral science, false negatives often constitute a more serious problem. Referring to Wason’s (1960) seminal work on inductive reasoning, we show that the failure to assertively generate and test alternative hypotheses can lead to dramatic theoretical mistakes, which cannot be corrected by any kind of rigor applied to statistical tests of the focal hypotheses. We conclude that a scientific culture rewarding strong inference (Platt, 1964) is more likely to see progress than a culture preoccupied with tightening its standards for the mere publication of original findings.},

Provision of the lifestyle intervention was associated with a significant 18\% relative risk reduction in the chance of infants being born with a birth weight above 4 kg. No other significant differences were identified in maternal pregnancy and birth outcomes between the two treatment groups. Observational studies highlight the association between a high infant birth weight and the subsequent risk of childhood and adulthood obesity. Antenatal interventions that are effective in reducing high infant birth weights therefore represent a significant strategy to tackle obesity from a population health perspective, while ongoing interrogation of the biospecimens and measurements, including ongoing childhood follow-up, will provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the mechanistic pathways of maternal-to-infant/childhood obesity.},

	abstract = {Background: Missing data are often an issue in electronic medical records (EMRs) research. However, there are many ways that people deal with missing data in drug safety studies. Aim: To compare the risk estimates resulting from different strategies for the handling of missing data in the study of venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk associated with antiosteoporotic medications (AOM). Methods: New users of AOM (alendronic acid, other bisphosphonates, strontium ranelate, selective estrogen receptor modulators, teriparatide, or denosumab) aged {\textgreater}/=50 years during 1998-2014 were identified in two Spanish (the Base de datos para la Investigacion Farmacoepidemiologica en Atencion Primaria [BIFAP] and EpiChron cohort) and one UK (Clinical Practice Research Datalink [CPRD]) EMR. Hazard ratios (HRs) according to AOM (with alendronic acid as reference) were calculated adjusting for VTE risk factors, body mass index (that was missing in 61\% of patients included in the three databases), and smoking (that was missing in 23\% of patients) in the year of AOM therapy initiation. HRs and standard errors obtained using cross-sectional multiple imputation (MI) (reference method) were compared to complete case (CC) analysis - using only patients with complete data - and longitudinal MI - adding to the cross-sectional MI model the body mass index/smoking values as recorded in the year before and after therapy initiation. Results: Overall, 422/95,057 (0.4\%), 19/12,688 (0.1\%), and 2,051/161,202 (1.3\%) VTE cases/participants were seen in BIFAP, EpiChron, and CPRD, respectively. HRs moved from 100.00\% underestimation to 40.31\% overestimation in CC compared with cross-sectional MI, while longitudinal MI methods provided similar risk estimates compared with cross-sectional MI. Precision for HR improved in cross-sectional MI versus CC by up to 160.28\%, while longitudinal MI improved precision (compared with cross-sectional) only minimally (up to 0.80\%). Conclusion: CC may substantially affect relative risk estimation in EMR-based drug safety studies, since missing data are not often completely at random. Little improvement was seen in these data in terms of power with the inclusion of longitudinal MI compared with cross-sectional MI. The strategy for handling missing data in drug safety studies can have a large impact on both risk estimates and precision.},

The target population was US people infected with HIV in 2006, as estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results from the trial apply, albeit muted by 12\%, to the target population, under the assumption that the authors have measured and correctly modeled the determinants of selection that reflect heterogeneity in the treatment effect. In simulations with a heterogeneous treatment effect, a conventional intent-to-treat estimate was biased with poor confidence limit coverage, but the proposed estimate was largely unbiased with appropriate confidence limit coverage.

When the study sample is not a random sample of the target population, the sample average treatment effect, even if internally valid, cannot usually be expected to equal the average treatment effect in the target population. The utility of an effect estimate for planning purposes and decision making will depend on the degree of departure from the true causal effect in the target population due to problems with both internal and external validity. Herein, we review concepts from recent literature on generalizability, one facet of external validity, using the potential outcomes framework. Identification conditions sufficient for external validity closely parallel identification conditions for internal validity, namely conditional exchangeability; positivity; the same distributions of the versions of treatment; no interference; and no measurement error. We also require correct model specification. Under these conditions, we discuss how a version of direct standardization (the g-formula, adjustment formula, or transport formula) or inverse probability weighting can be used to generalize a causal effect from a study sample to a well-defined target population, and demonstrate their application in an illustrative example.},

In the absence of randomized trials, 2 possible approaches are the parametric g-formula and agent-based models (ABMs). The g-formula has been used exclusively to estimate effects in the population from which data were collected, whereas ABMs are commonly used to estimate effects in multiple populations, necessitating stronger assumptions. Here, we describe potential biases that arise when ABM assumptions do not hold. To do so, we estimated 12-month mortality risk in simulated populations differing in prevalence of an unknown common cause of mortality and a time-varying confounder. The ABM and g-formula correctly estimated mortality and causal effects when all inputs were from the target population. However, whenever any inputs came from another population, the ABM gave biased estimates of mortality-and often of causal effects even when the true effect was null. In the absence of unmeasured confounding and model misspecification, both methods produce valid causal inferences for a given population when all inputs are from that population. However, ABMs may result in bias when extrapolated to populations that differ on the distribution of unmeasured outcome determinants, even when the causal network linking variables is identical.},

Our explanation of the examples is based on recent theoretical developments and insights in the context of large health care databases. Terminology is sometimes ambiguous for what constitutes effect modification and interaction. The strong assumptions underlying the assessment of interaction, and particularly mediation, require clinicians and epidemiologists to take extra care when conducting observational studies in the context of health care databases.

	abstract = {There is no complete solution for the problem of abuse of statistics, but methodological training needs to cover cognitive biases and other psychosocial factors affecting inferences. The present paper discusses 3 common cognitive distortions: 1) dichotomania, the compulsion to perceive quantities as dichotomous even when dichotomization is unnecessary and misleading, as in inferences based on whether a P value is "statistically significant"; 2) nullism, the tendency to privilege the hypothesis of no difference or no effect when there is no scientific basis for doing so, as when testing only the null hypothesis; and 3) statistical reification, treating hypothetical data distributions and statistical models as if they reflect known physical laws rather than speculative assumptions for thought experiments. As commonly misused, null-hypothesis significance testing combines these cognitive problems to produce highly distorted interpretation and reporting of study results. Interval estimation has so far proven to be an inadequate solution because it involves dichotomization, an avenue for nullism. Sensitivity and bias analyses have been proposed to address reproducibility problems (Am J Epidemiol. 2017;186(6):646-647); these methods can indeed address reification, but they can also introduce new distortions via misleading specifications for bias parameters. P values can be reframed to lessen distortions by presenting them without reference to a cutoff, providing them for relevant alternatives to the null, and recognizing their dependence on all assumptions used in their computation; they nonetheless require rescaling for measuring evidence. I conclude that methodological development and training should go beyond coverage of mechanistic biases (e.g., confounding, selection bias, measurement error) to cover distortions of conclusions produced by statistical methods and psychosocial forces.},

This is a time of relative analytical inaccessibility. We have used a large national biobank of amniotic fluid samples collected at routine amniocentesis to determine the impacts of exogenous endocrine disruptor load on specific fetal biomarkers at this critical time. While adrenal and testicular steroids are highly correlated, they are also mostly positively influenced by increasing phthalate load, represented by the metabolites 7cx-MMeHP and 5cx-MEPP, by perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure, and by smoking, suggesting an adrenal stress response. In contrast, the testis specific biomarkers insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3) and androstenedione are negatively impacted by the phthalate endocrine disruptors. Using a case-control design, we show that cryptorchidism and hypospadias are both significantly associated with increased amniotic concentration of INSL3 during gestational weeks 13-16, and some, though not all steroid biomarkers. Cases are also linked to a specifically increased variance in the Leydig cell biomarker INSL3 compared to controls, an effect exacerbated by maternal smoking. No influence of phthalate metabolites or PFOS was evident on the distribution of cases and controls. Considering that several animal and human studies have shown a negative impact of phthalate load on fetal and cord blood INSL3, respectively, the present results suggest that such endocrine disruptors may rather be altering the relative dynamics of testicular development and consequent hormone production, leading to a desynchronization of tissue organization during fetal development. Being born small for gestational age appears not to impact on the testicular biomarker INSL3 in second trimester amniotic fluid.},

	abstract = {Decisions about when to start or switch a therapy often depend on the frequency with which individuals are monitored or tested. For example, the optimal time to switch antiretroviral therapy depends on the frequency with which HIV-positive individuals have HIV RNA measured. This paper describes an approach to use observational data for the comparison of joint monitoring and treatment strategies and applies the method to a clinically relevant question in HIV research: when can monitoring frequency be decreased and when should individuals switch from a first-line treatment regimen to a new regimen? We outline the target trial that would compare the dynamic strategies of interest and then describe how to emulate it using data from HIV-positive individuals included in the HIV-CAUSAL Collaboration and the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems. When, as in our example, few individuals follow the dynamic strategies of interest over long periods of follow-up, we describe how to leverage an additional assumption: no direct effect of monitoring on the outcome of interest. We compare our results with and without the "no direct effect" assumption. We found little differences on survival and AIDS-free survival between strategies where monitoring frequency was decreased at a CD4 threshold of 350 cells/mul compared with 500 cells/mul and where treatment was switched at an HIV-RNA threshold of 1000 copies/ml compared with 200 copies/ml. The "no direct effect" assumption resulted in efficiency improvements for the risk difference estimates ranging from an 7- to 53-fold increase in the effective sample size.},

Lab studies suggest opioids modify cancer cell growth but the association of opioids with cancer progression in humans is not clear. This review aims to summarize recent findings related to opioid use and breast cancer progression. RECENT FINDINGS: Opioid-sparing analgesia may be associated with better survival in cancer patients. In-vitro research suggests that treatment with mu-opioid receptor antagonists inhibits cancer proliferation, and shows some promise for attenuating tumor growth in humans, thereby enhancing survival. Prescription use of opioids does not appear to influence the risk of recurrence in patients, though the evidence comes from a single large registry-based observational study. Ongoing clinical trials are comparing opioid-sparing regional anesthesia with general anesthesia for the risk of breast cancer recurrence. SUMMARY: The association of opioids with breast cancer progression is controversial. Further observational studies are needed. There is currently no clear evidence to suggest that opioid use should be avoided in breast cancer patients because of concerns regarding the risk of breast cancer recurrence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypothyroidism may occur as a late effect of breast cancer-directed treatment, particularly after radiotherapy, but little is known whether hypothyroidism affects the prognosis after breast cancer. We investigated the association between hypothyroidism and breast cancer recurrence, and all-cause mortality. METHODS: In this population-based cohort study, we used national medical registries to identify all Danish women 35 years or older diagnosed with stage I-III, operable breast cancer between 1996 and 2009. Hypothyroidism was defined as hospital diagnoses ascertained via diagnostic codes, or as prescriptions for levothyroxine. Two analytic models were used: (i) hypothyroidism present at the time of the breast cancer diagnosis (prevalent) and (ii) hypothyroidism diagnosed during follow-up as a time-varying exposure lagged by 1 year (incident). Breast cancer recurrence was defined as any local, regional, or distant recurrence or contralateral breast cancer. All-cause mortality included death from any cause in any setting. We used Cox regression models accounting for competing risks to compute adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) of breast cancer recurrence and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: The study cohort included 35,463 women with breast cancer with 212,641 person-years of follow-up. At diagnosis, 1272 women had hypothyroidism and 859 women developed hypothyroidism during follow-up. In total, 5810 patients developed recurrent breast cancer. Neither prevalent nor incident hypothyroidism was associated with breast cancer recurrence (adjusted HRprevalent 1.01, 95\% CI 0.87-1.19; adjusted HRincident 0.93, 95\% CI 0.75-1.16, respectively). Furthermore, no differences were seen for all-cause mortality for prevalent or incident hypothyroidism (adjusted HRprevalent 1.02, 95\% CI 0.92-1.14, and HRincident 1.08, 95\% CI 0.95-1.23, respectively). Stratification by menopausal status, oestrogen receptor status, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy did not alter the estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Hypothyroidism present at diagnosis or during follow-up was not associated with breast cancer recurrence or all-cause mortality in women with breast cancer. Our findings provide reassurance to patients and their physicians that hypothyroidism is unlikely to impact on the clinical course of breast cancer or survival.},

The literature finds elevated risk of spontaneous abortion among women who report adverse financial life events. This work suggests that, at the population level, national economic decline-an ambient and plausibly unexpected stressor-will precede an increase in spontaneous abortion. We tested this hypothesis using high-quality information on pregnancy and spontaneous loss for all women in Denmark. We applied time-series methods to monthly counts of clinically detected spontaneous abortions (n = 157,449) and the unemployment rate in Denmark beginning in January 1995 and ending in December 2009. Our statistical methods controlled for temporal patterns in spontaneous abortion (e.g., seasonality, trend) and changes in the population of pregnancies at risk of loss. Unexpected increases in the unemployment rate preceded by 1 month a rise in the number of spontaneous abortions (beta = 33.19 losses/month, 95\% confidence interval: 8.71, 57.67). An attendant analysis that used consumption of durable household goods as an indicator of financial insecurity supported the inference from our main test. Changes over time in elective abortions and in the cohort composition of high-risk pregnancies did not account for results. It appears that in Denmark, ambient stressors as common as increasing unemployment may precede a population-level increase in spontaneous abortion.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Quantitative estimates of the magnitude, direction, and rate of change of health inequalities play a crucial role in creating and assessing policies aimed at eliminating the disproportionate burden of disease in disadvantaged populations. It is generally assumed that the measurement of health inequalities is a value-neutral process, providing objective data that are then interpreted using normative judgments about whether a particular distribution of health is just, fair, or socially acceptable. METHODS: We discuss five examples in which normative judgments play a role in the measurement process itself, through either the selection of one measurement strategy to the exclusion of others or the selection of the type, significance, or weight assigned to the variables being measured. FINDINGS: Overall, we find that many commonly used measures of inequality are value laden and that the normative judgments implicit in these measures have important consequences for interpreting and responding to health inequalities. CONCLUSIONS: Because values implicit in the generation of health inequality measures may lead to radically different interpretations of the same underlying data, we urge researchers to explicitly consider and transparently discuss the normative judgments underlying their measures. We also urge policymakers and other consumers of health inequalities data to pay close attention to the measures on which they base their assessments of current and future health policies.},

The availability of multiple heterogeneous datasets presents new opportunities to big data analysts, because the knowledge that can be acquired from combined data would not be possible from any individual source alone. However, the biases that emerge in heterogeneous environments require new analytical tools. Some of these biases, including confounding, sampling selection, and cross-population biases, have been addressed in isolation, largely in restricted parametric models. We here present a general, nonparametric framework for handling these biases and, ultimately, a theoretical solution to the problem of data fusion in causal inference tasks.},

Recent theoretical and methodological developments have helped clarify a number of principles of confounder selection. When complete knowledge of a causal diagram relating all covariates to each other is available, graphical rules can be used to make decisions about covariate control. Unfortunately, such complete knowledge is often unavailable. This paper puts forward a practical approach to confounder selection decisions when the somewhat less stringent assumption is made that knowledge is available for each covariate whether it is a cause of the exposure, and whether it is a cause of the outcome. Based on recent theoretically justified developments in the causal inference literature, the following proposal is made for covariate control decisions: control for each covariate that is a cause of the exposure, or of the outcome, or of both; exclude from this set any variable known to be an instrumental variable; and include as a covariate any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome. Various principles of confounder selection are then further related to statistical covariate selection methods.},

Conversely, there were many examples of epidemiological studies promoting ineffective interventions, and little evident attempt to account for such failure. Major advances in concrete understanding of disease aetiology have been driven by a willingness to learn about, and incorporate, developments in biology and other cognate disciplines into epidemiology. If fundamental epidemiological principles regarding the rooting of disease risk within populations are retained, the combination of recent methodological developments with increased biological understanding and data sciences capability should herald in a fruitful post-"Modern Epidemiology" world.},

In this paper, the authors examine the consequences of baseline adjustment, using for illustration the question of the effect of educational attainment on change in cognitive function in old age. With data from the US-based Assets and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old survey (n = 5,726; born before 1924), they show that adjustment for baseline cognitive test score substantially inflates regression coefficient estimates for the effect of schooling on change in cognitive test scores compared with models without baseline adjustment. To explain this finding, they consider various plausible assumptions about relations among variables. Each set of assumptions is represented by a causal diagram. The authors apply simple rules for assessing causal diagrams to demonstrate that, in many plausible situations, baseline adjustment induces a spurious statistical association between education and change in cognitive score. More generally, when exposures are associated with baseline health status, this bias can arise if change in health status preceded baseline assessment or if the dependent variable measurement is unreliable or unstable. In some cases, change-score analyses without baseline adjustment provide unbiased causal effect estimates when baseline-adjusted estimates are biased.},

	doi = {10.1093/ije/dyz032},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Missing data are unavoidable in epidemiological research, potentially leading to bias and loss of precision. Multiple imputation (MI) is widely advocated as an improvement over complete case analysis (CCA). However, contrary to widespread belief, CCA is preferable to MI in some situations. METHODS: We provide guidance on choice of analysis when data are incomplete. Using causal diagrams to depict missingness mechanisms, we describe when CCA will not be biased by missing data and compare MI and CCA, with respect to bias and efficiency, in a range of missing data situations. We illustrate selection of an appropriate method in practice. RESULTS: For most regression models, CCA gives unbiased results when the chance of being a complete case does not depend on the outcome after taking the covariates into consideration, which includes situations where data are missing not at random. Consequently, there are situations in which CCA analyses are unbiased while MI analyses, assuming missing at random (MAR), are biased. By contrast MI, unlike CCA, is valid for all MAR situations and has the potential to use information contained in the incomplete cases and auxiliary variables to reduce bias and/or improve precision. For this reason, MI was preferred over CCA in our real data example. CONCLUSIONS: Choice of method for dealing with missing data is crucial for validity of conclusions, and should be based on careful consideration of the reasons for the missing data, missing data patterns and the availability of auxiliary information.},

	doi = {10.1200/JCO.18.02202},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Phthalate exposure is ubiquitous and especially high among users of drug products formulated with phthalates. Some phthalates mimic estradiol and may promote breast cancer. Existing epidemiologic studies on this topic are small, mostly not prospective, and have given inconsistent results. We estimated associations between longitudinal phthalate exposures and breast cancer risk in a Danish nationwide cohort, using redeemed prescriptions for phthalate-containing drug products to measure exposure. METHODS: We ascertained the phthalate content of drugs marketed in Denmark using an internal Danish Medicines Agency ingredient database. We enrolled a Danish nationwide cohort of 1.12 million women at risk for a first cancer diagnosis on January 1, 2005. By combining drug ingredient data with the Danish National Prescription registry, we characterized annual, cumulative phthalate exposure through redeemed prescriptions. We then fit multivariable Cox regression models to estimate associations between phthalate exposures and incident invasive breast carcinoma according to tumor estrogen receptor status. RESULTS: Over 9.99 million woman-years of follow-up, most phthalate exposures were not associated with breast cancer incidence. High-level dibutyl phthalate exposure ({\textgreater}/= 10,000 cumulative mg) was associated with an approximately two-fold increase in the rate of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer (hazard ratio, 1.9; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 3.5), consistent with in vitro evidence for an estrogenic effect of this compound. Lower levels of dibutyl phthalate exposure were not associated with breast cancer incidence. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that women should avoid high-level exposure to dibutyl phthalate, such as through long-term treatment with pharmaceuticals formulated with dibutyl phthalate.},

	abstract = {The study presented here is the first detailed nosographic analysis of migraine aura, diagnosed using the criteria of the International Headache Society, in a sufficiently large sample for statistical analysis. Of 4,000 people, 163 had migraine with aura. Sixty-two had attacks of migraine aura with headache as well as migraine aura without headache, and seven had exclusively migraine aura without headache. Visual symptoms were most frequent (99\%), followed by sensory (31\%), aphasic (18\%) and motor (6\%) symptoms. Those with several types of aura symptoms had visual aura in virtually every attack, while sensory, motor and aphasic aura were present only in a small number of their attacks. The typical visual aura starts as a flickering, uncoloured, zig-zag line in the centre of the visual field and affect the central vision. It gradually progresses towards the periphery of one hemifield and often leaves a scotoma. The typical sensory aura is unilateral, starts in the hand, progresses towards the arm and then affects the face and tongue. The typical motor aura is half-sided and affects the hand and arm. The visual, sensory and aphasic auras rarely lasted {\textgreater} 1 h, while the motor aura did in 67\% (six out of nine). Four people had exclusively acute onset visual aura. The duration of the aura and the characteristics of the ensuing headache were typical for migraine with aura, suggesting that acute onset aura is a real phenomenon. Headache followed the aura in 93\%, headache and aura occurred simultaneously in 4\% and aura followed headache in 3\%. The characteristic spread of each symptom and the sequence of different symptoms suggest that cortical spreading depression is the mechanism underlying the migraine aura. Our results do not suggest that alterations of the diagnostic criteria of the International Headache Society are needed. The intra-individual variation of aura symptoms shown in this study indicates that a simplification of the International Classification of Diseases, Neurological Adaptation is appropriate.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence, sociodemographic profile, and the burden of migraine in the United States in 1999 and to compare results with the original American Migraine Study, a 1989 population-based study employing identical methods. METHODS: A validated, self-administered questionnaire was mailed to a sample of 20 000 households in the United States. Each household member with severe headache was asked to respond to questions about symptoms, frequency, and severity of headaches and about headache-related disability. Diagnostic criteria for migraine were based on those of the International Headache Society. This report is restricted to individuals 12 years and older. RESULTS: Of the 43 527 age-eligible individuals, 29 727 responded to the questionnaire for a 68.3\% response rate. The prevalence of migraine was 18.2\% among females and 6.5\% among males. Approximately 23\% of households contained at least one member suffering from migraine. Migraine prevalence was higher in whites than in blacks and was inversely related to household income. Prevalence increased from aged 12 years to about aged 40 years and declined thereafter in both sexes. Fifty-three percent of respondents reported that their severe headaches caused substantial impairment in activities or required bed rest. Approximately 31\% missed at least 1 day of work or school in the previous 3 months because of migraine; 51\% reported that work or school productivity was reduced by at least 50\%. CONCLUSIONS: Two methodologically identical national surveys in the United States conducted 10 years apart show that the prevalence and distribution of migraine have remained stable over the last decade. Migraine-associated disability remains substantial and pervasive. The number of migraineurs has increased from 23.6 million in 1989 to 27.9 million in 1999 commensurate with the growth of the population. Migraine is an important target for public health interventions because it is highly prevalent and disabling.},

There is no record of one individual's long-term experience.

Observations were made on several aspects of the visual event itself--evolution, pattern, scotoma, coloration, duration, lateralization, etc. The chronological distribution of spells, circumstances of occurrence, time of day, the season, etc were noted. The study was observational in nature. Documentation of this experience could be of value clinically and scientifically. RESULTS: The spells occurred irregularly, unrelated to season, time of day, activity at onset, diet, and temperamental state. The characteristic appearance was a flickering zigzag line that began centrally and migrated to the periphery. The display, which was stereotyped, was achromatic. The average duration was 15 minutes. Both visual fields were equally involved, never at the same time. The details of the scintillating zigzag line are actually complex and an account of the observations of others and of the author is included here.},

DESIGN: A population-based cohort study. SETTING: Singletons liveborn in Denmark between 1991 and 2004. POPULATION: A total of 857 014 singletons alive and living in Denmark at the age of 3 years. METHODS: Information on the diagnosis and/or treatment of maternal thyroid disease and the neurodevelopmental disorders ADHD and ASD in the child was obtained from Danish nationwide registers. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) with 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) for risk of ADHD and ASD in children born to mothers with thyroid dysfunction, adjusting for potential confounding factors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ADHD and ASD in the child. RESULTS: Altogether, 30,295 singletons (3.5\%) were born to mothers with thyroid dysfunction. Maternal hyperthyroidism diagnosed and treated for the first time after the birth of the child increased the risk of ADHD in the child (adjusted HR 1.23; 95\% CI 1.05-1.44), whereas hypothyroidism increased the risk of ASD (adjusted HR 1.34; 95\% CI 1.14-1.59). No significant association was seen for maternal diagnosis and treatment prior to the birth of the child. CONCLUSIONS: Children born to mothers diagnosed and treated for the first time for thyroid dysfunction after their birth may have been exposed to abnormal levels of maternal thyroid hormone already present during the pregnancy, and this untreated condition could increase the risk of specific neurodevelopmental disorders in the child.},

We determined the frequency, characteristics, and stroke outcome of these symptoms in the Framingham Study. METHODS: During 1971-1989, at biennial examinations, 2110 subjects of the Framingham cohort were systematically queried about the occurrence of sudden visual symptoms. RESULTS: Visual migrainous symptoms were reported by 1.23\% (26/2110) of subjects (1.33\% of women and 1.08\% of men). In 65\% of subjects the episodes were stereotyped, and they began after age 50 years in 77\%. Mean +/- SD age at onset of the episodes was 56.2+/-18.7 years. In 58\% of subjects the episodes were never accompanied by headaches, and 42\% had no headache history. The number of episodes ranged from 1 to 500 and was 10 or more in 69\% of subjects. The episodes lasted 15 to 60 minutes in 50\% of subjects. Sixty-five percent of the subjects were examined by a study neurologist, and only 19\% of them met the criteria of the International Headache Society. Twelve percent of subjects sustained a stroke after the onset of migrainous visual symptoms: a subarachnoid hemorrhage 1 year later, an atherothrombotic brain stem infarct 3 years later, and a cardioembolic stroke 27 years later. In contrast, of 87 subjects with TIAs in the same cohort, 33\% developed a stroke (P = 0.030), two thirds within 6 months of TIA onset. CONCLUSIONS: Late-life-onset transient visual phenomena similar to the visual aura of migraine are not rare and often occur in the absence of headache.

Two comparator groups, women with hypertension treated with other antihypertensives, and healthy controls were also recruited. Baseline maternal characteristics were not different among the three groups. There were no differences in rates of major malformations. Both the ACE-ARBs and disease-matched groups exhibited significantly lower birth weight and gestational ages than the healthy controls (P {\textless} 0.001 for both variables). There was a significantly higher rate of miscarriage noted in the ACE/ARB group (P {\textless} 0.001).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Progesterone is a critical hormone in early pregnancy. A low level of serum progesterone is associated with threatened miscarriage. We aim to establish the distribution of maternal serum progesterone in normal pregnancies compared to pregnancies complicated by threatened miscarriage from 5 to 13 weeks gestation. METHODS: This is a single centre, prospective cohort study of 929 patients. Women from the Normal Pregnancy [NP] cohort were recruited from antenatal clinics, and those in the Threatened Miscarriage [TM] cohort were recruited from emergency walk-in clinics. Women with multiple gestations, missed, incomplete or inevitable miscarriage were excluded from the study. Quantile regression was used to characterize serum progesterone levels in the NP and TM cohorts by estimating the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles from 5 to 13 weeks gestation. Pregnancy outcome was determined at 16 weeks of gestation. Subgroup analysis within the TM group compared progesterone levels of women who subsequently miscarried with those who had ongoing pregnancies at 16 weeks of gestation. RESULTS: Median serum progesterone concentration demonstrated a linearly increasing trend from 57.5 nmol/L to 80.8 nmol/L from 5 to 13 weeks gestation in the NP cohort. In the TM cohort, median serum progesterone concentration increased from 41.7 nmol/L to 78.1 nmol/L. However, median progesterone levels were uniformly lower in the TM cohort by approximately 10 nmol/L at every gestation week. In the subgroup analysis, median serum progesterone concentration in women with ongoing pregnancy at 16 weeks gestation demonstrated a linearly increasing trend from 5 to 13 weeks gestation. There was a marginal and non-significant increase in serum progesterone from 19.0 to 30.3 nmol/L from 5 to 13 weeks gestation in women who eventually had a spontaneous miscarriage. CONCLUSIONS: Serum progesterone concentration increased linearly with gestational age from 5 to 13 weeks in women with normal pregnancies. Women with spontaneous miscarriage showed a marginal and non-significant increase in serum progesterone. This study highlights the pivotal role of progesterone in supporting an early pregnancy, with lower serum progesterone associated with threatened miscarriage and a subsequent complete miscarriage at 16 weeks gestation.},

	abstract = {AIMS: The Nordic countries have a strong tradition of using nationwide social and health registers for research purposes. The aim of the current paper is to provide an overview of the Danish population-based registers in public health and health-related research, and to discuss their strengths and limitations. METHODS: Danish registers on somatic and psychiatric hospital contacts as well as care provided by general practitioners were reviewed. The availability of demographic, individual-level variables of relevance for health-related research was summarized. RESULTS: Since 1968, every person living in Denmark has a unique identifier. This identifier is listed in Danish registers enabling linkage of information from a range of registers on an individual level. The nationwide coverage of all patient contacts at somatic and psychiatric hospitals, consultations with general practitioners, purchases of prescribed medications, and a complete follow-up with respect to causes of death support public health studies surveying trends of prevalence and incidence. Historical data on psychiatric and somatic hospitalizations since 1969 and 1977, respectively, allow an in-depth assessment of the burden of disease and time trends. Demographic characteristics of individuals and family units, together with information on education, employment, income, place of residence and migration, are provided by social registers. CONCLUSIONS: Register data are fully representative of the entire population with no loss to follow-up. Nationwide coverage also ensures a large sample to investigate events and conditions with low base rates. Clinical observations are limited and often only available for select patient populations. However, the opportunities available for public health research through linkage of register data with the increasing number of nationwide clinical databases, bio-banks and surveys entail promising perspectives for future research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Validation of health administrative data for identifying patients with different health states (diseases and conditions) is a research priority, but no guidelines exist for ensuring quality. We created reporting guidelines for studies validating administrative data identification algorithms and used them to assess the quality of reporting of validation studies in the literature. METHODS: Using Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic accuracy (STARD) criteria as a guide, we created a 40-item checklist of items with which identification accuracy studies should be reported. A systematic review identified studies that validated identification algorithms using administrative data. We used the checklist to assess the quality of reporting. RESULTS: In 271 included articles, goals and data sources were well reported but few reported four or more statistical estimates of accuracy (36.9\%). In 65.9\% of studies reporting positive predictive value (PPV)/negative predictive value (NPV), the prevalence of disease in the validation cohort was higher than in the administrative data, potentially falsely elevating predictive values. Subgroup accuracy (53.1\%) and 95\% confidence intervals for accuracy measures (35.8\%) were also underreported. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of studies validating health states in the administrative data varies, with significant deficits in reporting of markers of diagnostic accuracy, including the appropriate estimation of PPV and NPV. These omissions could lead to misclassification bias and incorrect estimation of incidence and health services utilization rates. Use of a reporting checklist, such as the one created for this study by modifying the STARD criteria, could improve the quality of reporting of validation studies, allowing for accurate application of algorithms, and interpretation of research using health administrative data.},

SETTING: Denmark. POPULATION: All women with at least one live birth or stillbirth between 1978 and 2015. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Hazard ratios comparing dementia rates among women with and without a history of pre-eclampsia, estimated using Cox regression. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 1 178 005 women with 20 352 695 person years of follow-up. Women with a history of pre-eclampsia had more than three times the risk of vascular dementia (hazard ratio 3.46, 95\% confidence interval 1.97 to 6.10) later in life, compared with women with no history of pre-eclampsia. The association with vascular dementia seemed to be stronger for late onset disease (hazard ratio 6.53, 2.82 to 15.1) than for early onset disease (2.32, 1.06 to 5.06) (P=0.08). Adjustment for diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease attenuated the hazard ratios only moderately; sensitivity analyses suggested that body mass index was unlikely to explain the association with vascular dementia. In contrast, only modest associations were observed for Alzheimer's disease (hazard ratio 1.45, 1.05 to 1.99) and other/unspecified dementia (1.40, 1.08 to 1.83). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-eclampsia was associated with an increased risk of dementia, particularly vascular dementia. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes were unlikely to mediate the associations substantially, suggesting that pre-eclampsia and vascular dementia may share underlying mechanisms or susceptibility pathways. Asking about a history of pre-eclampsia could help physicians to identify women who might benefit from screening for early signs of disease, allowing for early clinical intervention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: When exposure is infrequent, propensity-score matching results in reduced precision because it discards a large proportion of unexposed patients. To our knowledge, the relative performance of propensity-score stratification in these circumstances has not been examined. METHODS: Using an empirical example of the association of first trimester statin exposure (prevalence = 0.04\%) with risk of congenital malformations and 1,000 simulated cohorts (n = 20,000) with eight combinations of exposure prevalence (0.5\%, 1\%, 5\%, 10\%) and outcome risk (3.5\%, 10\%), we compared four propensity-score-based approaches to confounding adjustment: (1) matching (1:1, 1:5, full), (2) stratification in 10, 50, and 100 strata by entire cohort propensity-score distribution, (3) stratification in 10, 50, and 100 strata by exposed group propensity-score distribution, (4) standardized mortality ratio (SMR) weighting. Weighted generalized linear models were used to derive effect estimates after weighting unexposed according to the distribution of the exposed in their stratum for the stratification approaches. RESULTS: In the empirical example, propensity-score stratification (cohort) approaches resulted in greater imbalances in covariate distributions between statin-exposed and unexposed compared with propensity-score stratification (exposed) and matching. In simulations, propensity-score stratification (exposed) resulted in smaller relative bias than the cohort approach with 10 and 50 strata, and greater precision than matching and SMR weighting at 0.5\% and 1\% exposure prevalence, but similar performance at 5\% and 10\%. CONCLUSION: For exposures with prevalence under 5\%, propensity-score stratification with fine strata, based on the exposed group propensity-score distribution, produced the best results. For more common exposures, all approaches were equivalent.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate healthcare costs associated with hyperkalaemia (HK) among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), heart failure (HF) or diabetes. DESIGN: Before-after cohort study of patients with HK and matched patients without HK. SETTING: Population-based databases covering primary and secondary care for the entire of Northern Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a first incident record of CKD (n=78 372), HF (n=14 233) or diabetes (n=37 479) during 2005-2011. Among all patients experiencing a first HK event (potassium level {\textgreater}5.0 mmol/L), healthcare costs were compared during 6 months before and 6 months after the HK event. The same cost assessment was conducted 6 months before and after a matched index date in a comparison cohort of patients without HK. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean costs of hospital care, general practice and dispensed drugs converted to 2018 Euros. RESULTS: Overall, 17 747 (23\%) CKD patients, 5141 (36\%) HF patients and 4183 (11\%) diabetes patients with a first HK event were identified. More than 40\% of all HK patients across the patient groups had subsequent HK events with successively shorter times between the events. In CKD patients, overall mean costs were euro5518 higher 6 months after versus before first HK, while euro441 higher in matched CKD patients without HK, yielding HK-associated costs of euro5077. Corresponding costs associated with a HK event were euro6018 in HF patients, and euro4862 in diabetes patients. CONCLUSIONS: Among CKD, HF and diabetes patients, an incident HK event was common, and a large proportion of the patients experienced recurrent HK events. Substantial increase in healthcare costs associated with a HK event was observed in the HK patients compared with non-HK patients. These results are important to better understand the potential economic impact of HK among high-risk comorbid patients in a real-wold setting and help inform decision-making for clinicians and healthcare providers.},

Two population-based case-control studies suggest a reduced risk of breast cancer associated with selective cyclooxygenase-2 (sCox-2) inhibitor use, but data regarding the association between breast cancer occurrence and use of non-selective NSAIDs are conflicting. METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study using Danish healthcare databases to examine if use of NSAIDs, including sCox-2 inhibitors, was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. We included 8,195 incident breast cancer cases diagnosed in 1991 through 2006 and 81,950 population controls. RESULTS: Overall, we found no reduced breast cancer risk in ever users ({\textgreater}2 prescriptions) of sCox-2 inhibitors (odds ratio (OR) = 1.08, 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) = 0.99, 1.18), aspirin (OR = 0.98, 95\% CI = 0.90-1.07), or non-selective NSAIDs OR = 1.04, (95\% CI = 0.98, 1.10)). Recent use ({\textgreater}2 prescriptions within two years of index date) of sCox-2 inhibitors, aspirin, or non-selective NSAIDs was likewise not associated with breast cancer risk (Ors = 1.06 (95\% CI = 0.96, 1.18), 0.96 (95\% CI = 0.87, 1.06) and 0.99 (95\% CI = 0.85, 1.16), respectively). Risk estimates by duration ({\textless}10, 10 to 15, 15+ years) or intensity (low/medium/high) of NSAID use were also close to unity. Regardless of intensity, shorter or long-term NSAID use was not significantly associated with breast cancer risk.

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Studies on the association between attendance at religious services and mortality often have been limited by inadequate methods for reverse causation, inability to assess effects over time, and limited information on mediators and cause-specific mortality. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations between attendance at religious services and subsequent mortality in women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Attendance at religious services was assessed from the first questionnaire in 1992 through June 2012, by a self-reported question asked of 74534 women in the Nurses' Health Study who were free of cardiovascular disease and cancer at baseline. Data analysis was conducted from return of the 1996 questionnaire through June 2012. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cox proportional hazards regression model and marginal structural models with time-varying covariates were used to examine the association of attendance at religious services with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. We adjusted for a wide range of demographic covariates, lifestyle factors, and medical history measured repeatedly during the follow-up, and performed sensitivity analyses to examine the influence of potential unmeasured and residual confounding. RESULTS: Among the 74534 women participants, there were 13537 deaths, including 2721 owing to cardiovascular deaths and 4479 owing to cancer deaths. After multivariable adjustment for major lifestyle factors, risk factors, and attendance at religious services in 1992, attending a religious service more than once per week was associated with 33\% lower all-cause mortality compared with women who had never attended religious services (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95\% CI, 0.62-0.71; P {\textless} .001 for trend). Comparing women who attended religious services more than once per week with those who never attend, the hazard ratio for cardiovascular mortality was 0.73 (95\% CI, 0.62-0.85; P {\textless} .001 for trend) and for cancer mortality was 0.79 (95\% CI, 0.70-0.89; P {\textless} .001 for trend). Results were robust in sensitivity analysis. Depressive symptoms, smoking, social support, and optimism were potentially important mediators, although the overall proportion of the association between attendance at religious services and mortality was moderate (eg, social support explained 23\% of the effect [P = .003], depressive symptoms explained 11\% [P {\textless} .001], smoking explained 22\% [P {\textless} .001], and optimism explained 9\% [P {\textless} .001]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Frequent attendance at religious services was associated with significantly lower risk of all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality among women.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Social consequences of disease may be subject to register based follow-up. A Danish database, DREAM, allows weekly follow-up of any public transfer payment. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of the register for use in public health research. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The DREAM database includes information on all public transfer payments administered by Danish ministries, municipalities, and Statistics Denmark for all Danish citizens on a weekly basis since 1991. The DREAM database was compared with self-reported information on sources of income in a population survey from 2001 with about 5000 participants. RESULTS: According to DREAM, 80.2\% of respondents had received some kind of transfer income since 1991. For the week they filled in the questionnaire, 9.0\% had a record of labour-market-related benefit (unemployment benefit, social assistance, wage subsidy), 6.4\% a health-related benefit (sickness benefit, vocational rehabilitation allowance, salary from subsidized jobs for persons with limited work capacity, anticipatory pension), 10.1\% a voluntary retirement pension, while 74.4\% had no record of transfer payment for that week. The predictive value of DREAM was 74.8\% for health-related transfer payment and 98.2\% for self-support. Among persons with a record of sickness benefit, 52.4\% reported no transfer payment. CONCLUSION: The DREAM database is feasible for follow-up of social and economic consequences of disease. Respondents may be unaware of payments transferred by the public authorities to the employer, and in such cases DREAM may be the best source of information. The database is useful for public health research, but may also be useful for socioeconomic analyses of selection bias and dropout from other studies.},

We examined association of schizophrenia with upper GI bleeding (UGIB) and nonbleeding ulcers and associated risk factors and mortality. METHODS: We used the data linked from population-based registries in Denmark. Among patients with incident schizophrenia in 1980-2011, we computed cumulative incidences and standardized incidence ratios of UGIB, bleeding ulcers, and nonbleeding ulcers compared with the general population; evaluated risk factors for the 3 GI endpoints, including somatic and psychiatric comorbidity; and examined subsequent all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Among 39,998 patients with schizophrenia, the standardized incidence ratios were 2.92 (95\% confidence interval (CI), 2.76-3.08) for UGIB, 2.36 (95\% CI, 2.15-2.58) for bleeding ulcers, and 2.00 (95\% CI, 1.87-2.15) for nonbleeding ulcers. Risk factors for UGIB and nonbleeding ulcers included age, somatic comorbidity, and medication use. UGIB and nonbleeding ulcers were associated with the subsequent increase in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Schizophrenia is associated with an increased risk of UGIB and nonbleeding ulcers, whose risk factors in patients with schizophrenia are similar to those in the general population.},

When the goal is to guide decisions among several strategies, causal analyses of observational data need to be evaluated with respect to how well they emulate a particular target trial. We outline a framework for comparative effectiveness research using big data that makes the target trial explicit.

Biased estimation of the effect of an exposure on rate of cognitive decline can occur when mortality is a common effect of exposure and an unmeasured determinant of cognitive decline and in similar settings. This potential is often represented as collider-stratification bias in directed acyclic graphs, but it is difficult to anticipate the magnitude of bias. In this paper, we present a flexible simulation platform with which to quantify the expected bias in longitudinal studies of determinants of cognitive decline. We evaluated potential survival bias in naive analyses under several selective survival scenarios, assuming that exposure had no effect on cognitive decline for anyone in the population. Compared with the situation with no collider bias, the magnitude of bias was higher when exposure and an unmeasured determinant of cognitive decline interacted on the hazard ratio scale to influence mortality or when both exposure and rate of cognitive decline influenced mortality. Bias was, as expected, larger in high-mortality situations. This simulation platform provides a flexible tool for evaluating biases in studies with high mortality, as is common in cognitive aging research.},

RESULTS: Disease or exposure information bias always involves the use of an effect of the variable of interest - specifically, an effect of true disease status or an effect of true exposure status. The bias typically arises from a causal or an associational path of no interest to the researchers. In certain situations, it may be possible to prevent or remove some of the bias. CONCLUSIONS: Common types of information bias, just like confounding and selection bias, have a clear and helpful representation within the framework of causal diagrams.},

Using population-based health registries, we conducted a cohort study of all liveborn singleton boys in Denmark during 1979-2008. Boys with a diagnosis of cryptorchidism were categorized into the exposed cohort and the other boys into the unexposed comparison cohort. The outcomes were diagnoses of any neurodevelopmental disorders and their subtypes. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to compute hazard ratios (HRs), taking into consideration several potential confounders. Among 884,083 male infants, 27,505 received a diagnosis of cryptorchidism during follow-up. Boys with cryptorchidism were more likely to be diagnosed with intellectual disability (HR = 1.77; 95\%confidence interval [CI]:1.59,1.97), autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (HR = 1.24; 95\% CI:1.13,1.35), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (HR = 1.17; 95\% CI: 1.08,1.26), anxiety (HR = 1.09; 95\% CI: 1.01,1.17), and other behavioral/emotional disorders (HR = 1.16; 95\% CI: 1.08,1.26) compared to boys without cryptorchidism. The observed risks of intellectual disability, ASD, and ADHD were increased further in boys with bilateral cryptorchidism. Except for anxiety, cryptorchid boys had higher risks of neurodevelopmental disorders than their non-cryptorchid full brothers. The observed increased risks were similar among boys who underwent orchiopexy, as well as among those with shorter waiting times for this surgery. Cryptorchidism may be associated with increased risks of intellectual disability, ASD, ADHD, and other behavioral/emotional disorders. Cryptorchidism and neurodevelopmental disorders may have shared genetic or in-utero/early postnatal risk factors, which need to be further investigated.},

	abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Is the risk of hospital admission or outpatient contact for mental disorders increased in children born to women with fertility problems compared with children born to women without fertility problems? SUMMARY ANSWER: We found an increased risk of hospital admission or outpatient contact for mental disorders in children born to women with fertility problems. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Few studies have investigated the risk of mental disorders in children born after fertility treatment and although some studies have pointed to an increased risk, others found no association. The inconsistent results may be due to methodological constraints in many previous studies, including small sample size and short follow-up, resulting in imprecise risk estimates and lack of information on risk patterns of mental disorders in adulthood. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This nationwide retrospective register-based cohort study included all 2 412 721 children born in Denmark between 1969 and 2006. All children were followed from date of birth until date of hospital contact for a mental disorder, date of emigration, date of death or 31 December 2009, whichever occurred first. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Information concerning maternal fertility status for all children in the cohort was obtained by linkage to the Danish Infertility Cohort, which contains data on nearly all women with fertility problems in Denmark since 1963. A total of 124 269 (5\%) children were born to women with fertility problems and 2 288 452 (95\%) to women without fertility problems. To identify children hospitalized for a mental disorder, the cohort was linked to the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Registry. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between maternal fertility status and the risk of hospital admission or outpatient contact for various groups of mental disorders, including any mental disorder and all 11 main discharge diagnostic groups, classified according to the International Classification of Diseases, version 10. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: During a mean follow-up period of 21 years (range, 0-40 years), 168 686 (7\%) children were admitted to hospital or had an outpatient contact for a mental disorder. Children born to women with fertility problems had a significantly higher risk of any mental disorder (HR 1.23; 95\% CI 1.20-1.26) and for most of the 11 main discharge groups, including schizophrenia (HR 1.16; 95\% CI 1.07-1.27), mood (affective) disorders (HR 1.21; 95\% CI 1.15-1.28) and disorders of psychological development (HR 1.15; 95\% CI 1.09-1.21) as well as the subgroup of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (HR 1.36; 95\% CI 1.29-1.45) compared with children born to women without fertility problems. The risk estimates did not change markedly when analyses were performed separately for mental disorders diagnosed during childhood (0-19 years) and in young adulthood (20-40 years). LIMITATIONS, REASON FOR CAUTION: The true risk of mental disorders may be somewhat underestimated, as only severe disorders requiring hospital admission or outpatient contact were considered as events. Furthermore, we could not determine whether the increased risks observed were due to factors related to the underlying infertility or to fertility treatment procedures. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This is the first report on mental disorders in adulthood among children born to women with fertility problems. Furthermore, we have assessed the risk of several severe mental disorders not previously studied (e.g. neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders and disorders of adult personality and behaviour). These important findings should be investigated further in large epidemiological studies designed to differentiate between factors related to fertility treatment and to the underlying infertility. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: The study was supported by internal funding from the Unit of Virus, Lifestyle and Genes at the Danish Cancer Society Research Center.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between first-trimester vaginal bleeding and fetal growth patterns. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Studies-Singletons, a prospective cohort study of low-risk, nonobese women with healthy lifestyles. Duration of bleeding was self-reported at enrollment (10 0/7 to 13 6/7 weeks of gestation) and categorized as 0, 1, or more than 1 day. Longitudinal measures of fetal biometrics were obtained in up to six study visits, and estimated fetal weight was computed. Growth trajectories were created for biometrics and estimated fetal weight. When global tests among groups was significant (P{\textless}.05), week-specific global and pairwise differences were tested. Birth weight and risk of a small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonate were secondary outcomes. All analyses were adjusted for maternal age, weight, height, parity, and racial-ethnic group and neonatal sex in a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: In 2,307 eligible women, 410 (17.8\%) reported first-trimester bleeding, of whom 176 bled for 1 day and 234 bled for more than 1 day. Women with more than 1 day of bleeding demonstrated decreased fetal abdominal circumference from 34 to 39 weeks of gestation compared with women without bleeding. For women with more than 1 day of bleeding, compared with women without bleeding, estimated fetal weight was 68-107 g smaller from 35 to 39 weeks of gestation. Mean birth weight at term was 88 g smaller, confirming differences in calculated fetal weight, and SGA neonates were delivered to 148 (8.5\%), 9 (5.7\%), and 33 (15.7\%) women in the no bleeding, 1 day, and more than 1 day of bleeding groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: More than 1 day of first-trimester vaginal bleeding was associated with smaller estimated fetal weight late in pregnancy driven by smaller abdominal circumference. The magnitude of decrease in birth weight was small, albeit comparable with observed decreases associated with maternal smoking. It remains unknown whether early pregnancy bleeding is associated with short-term or long-term morbidity and whether additional intervention would be of benefit.

In this paper, we explicitly define the causal question that is asked by these studies and discuss the problems associated with it. We argue that observational studies of obesity and mortality violate the condition of consistency of counterfactual (potential) outcomes, a necessary condition for meaningful causal inference, because (1) they do not explicitly specify the interventions on body mass index (BMI) that are being compared and (2) different methods to modify BMI may lead to different counterfactual mortality outcomes, even if they lead to the same BMI value in a given person. Besides precluding the estimation of unambiguous causal effects, this violation of consistency affects the ability to address two additional conditions that are also necessary for causal inference: exchangeability and positivity. We conclude that consistency violations not only preclude the estimation of well-defined causal effects but also compromise our ability to estimate ill-defined causal effects.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We provide an introduction to causal inference with longitudinal data and discuss the complexities of analysis and interpretation when exposures can vary over time. METHODS: We consider what types of causal questions can be addressed with the standard regression-based analyses and what types of covariate control and control for the prior values of outcome and exposure must be made to reason about causal effects. We also consider newer classes of causal models, including marginal structural models, that can assess questions of the joint effects of time-varying exposures and can take into account feedback between the exposure and outcome over time. Such feedback renders cross-sectional data ineffective for drawing inferences about causation. RESULTS: The challenges are illustrated by analyses concerning potential effects of religious service attendance on depression, in which there may in fact be effects in both directions with service attendance preventing the subsequent depression, but depression itself leading to lower levels of the subsequent religious service attendance. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal designs, with careful control for prior exposures, outcomes, and confounders, and suitable methodology, will strengthen research on mental health, religion and health, and in the biomedical and social sciences generally.},

	abstract = {Importance: Having a child with a major birth defect can be a life-changing and stressful event that may be associated with higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, yet the long-term burden of CVD for the child's mother is unknown. Objective: To assess whether mothers of an infant born with a major congenital anomaly are at higher risk of CVD compared with a comparison cohort. Design, Setting, and Participants: A population-based cohort study using individual-level linked registry data in Denmark included 42943 women who gave birth to an infant with a major congenital anomaly between January 1, 1979, and December 31, 2013; and follow-up was conducted until 2015. A comparison group, comprising 428401 randomly selected women, was 10:1 matched to each affected mother by maternal age, parity, and her infant's year of birth. Data analyses were performed between November 1, 2017, and February 28, 2018. Exposures: Live birth of an infant with a major congenital anomaly. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a CVD composite outcome of acute myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or stroke. Secondary outcomes included individual components of the CVD composite and other cardiovascular outcomes, including unstable angina, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral artery disease, ischemic heart disease, and aortic aneurysm. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses generated hazard ratios (HRs), adjusted for maternal demographic, socioeconomic, and chronic health indicators. Results: Median maternal age at baseline was 28.8 years (interquartile range, 25.3-32.5 years). After a median follow-up of 19.5 years (interquartile range, 9.9-27.6 years), 914 women whose infant had a major congenital anomaly experienced a CVD event (1.21 per 1000 person-years; 95\% CI, 1.13-1.28 per 1000 person-years) vs 7516 women in the comparison group (0.99 per 1000 person-years; 95\% CI, 0.97-1.01 per 1000 person-years), corresponding to an unadjusted HR of 1.23 (95\% CI, 1.15-1.32), and an adjusted HR (aHR) of 1.15 (95\% CI, 1.07-1.23). Women who gave birth to an infant with multiorgan anomalies had an even higher aHR (1.37; 95\% CI, 1.08-1.72). Mothers of infants with a major anomaly also had an increased aHR of the individual components of the composite outcome and the other cardiovascular outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance: Women whose child had a major congenital anomaly experienced a 15\% to 37\% higher risk of premature cardiovascular disease. These women may benefit from targeted interventions aimed at improving their cardiovascular health.},

However, covariates are often measured with error, which leads to biased causal effect estimates if the true underlying covariates are the actual confounders. Although some groups have investigated the impact of a single mismeasured covariate on estimating a causal effect and proposed methods for handling the measurement error, fewer have investigated the case where multiple covariates are mismeasured, and we found none that discussed correlated measurement errors. In this study, we examined the consequences of multiple error-prone covariates when estimating causal effects using propensity score-based estimators via extensive simulation studies and real data analyses. We found that causal effect estimates are less biased when the propensity score model includes mismeasured covariates whose true underlying values are strongly correlated with each other. However, when the measurement errors are correlated with each other, additional bias is introduced. In addition, it is beneficial to include correctly measured auxiliary variables that are correlated with confounders whose true underlying values are mismeasured in the propensity score model.},

Although these findings have obvious implications in cases of known IVs, their meaning remains unclear in the more common scenario where investigators are uncertain whether a measured covariate meets the criteria for an IV or rather a confounder. The authors present results from two simulation studies designed to provide insight into the problem of conditioning on potential IVs in routine epidemiologic practice. The simulations explored the effects of conditioning on IVs, near-IVs (predictors of exposure that are weakly associated with outcome), and confounders on the bias and variance of a binary exposure effect estimate. The results indicate that effect estimates which are conditional on a perfect IV or near-IV may have larger bias and variance than the unconditional estimate. However, in most scenarios considered, the increases in error due to conditioning were small compared with the total estimation error. In these cases, minimizing unmeasured confounding should be the priority when selecting variables for adjustment, even at the risk of conditioning on IVs.},

In this issue of the Journal (Am J Epidemiol. 2011;174(11):1213-1222), Myers et al. compare the bias amplification of a near-instrumental variable with its bias-reducing potential and suggest that, in practice, the latter outweighs the former. The author of this commentary sheds broader light on this comparison by considering the cumulative effects of conditioning on multiple covariates and showing that bias amplification may build up at a faster rate than bias reduction.

We give results for additive, risk-ratio and odds-ratio scales. We show that these results encompass a number of more specific sensitivity-analysis methods in the statistics and epidemiology literature. The applicability, usefulness, and limits of the bias-adjustment formulas are discussed. We illustrate the sensitivity-analysis techniques that follow from our results by applying them to 3 different studies.

	abstract = {We propose a new criterion for confounder selection when the underlying causal structure is unknown and only limited knowledge is available. We assume all covariates being considered are pretreatment variables and that for each covariate it is known (i) whether the covariate is a cause of treatment, and (ii) whether the covariate is a cause of the outcome. The causal relationships the covariates have with one another is assumed unknown. We propose that control be made for any covariate that is either a cause of treatment or of the outcome or both. We show that irrespective of the actual underlying causal structure, if any subset of the observed covariates suffices to control for confounding then the set of covariates chosen by our criterion will also suffice. We show that other, commonly used, criteria for confounding control do not have this property. We use formal theory concerning causal diagrams to prove our result but the application of the result does not rely on familiarity with causal diagrams. An investigator simply need ask, "Is the covariate a cause of the treatment?" and "Is the covariate a cause of the outcome?" If the answer to either question is "yes" then the covariate is included for confounder control. We discuss some additional covariate selection results that preserve unconfoundedness and that may be of interest when used with our criterion.},

	abstract = {Many public health interventions provide benefits that extend beyond their direct recipients and impact people in close physical or social proximity who did not directly receive the intervention themselves. A classic example of this phenomenon is the herd protection provided by many vaccines. If these 'spillover effects' (i.e. 'herd effects') are present in the same direction as the effects on the intended recipients, studies that only estimate direct effects on recipients will likely underestimate the full public health benefits of the intervention. Causal inference assumptions for spillover parameters have been articulated in the vaccine literature, but many studies measuring spillovers of other types of public health interventions have not drawn upon that literature. In conjunction with a systematic review we conducted of spillovers of public health interventions delivered in low- and middle-income countries, we classified the most widely used spillover parameters reported in the empirical literature into a standard notation. General classes of spillover parameters include: cluster-level spillovers; spillovers conditional on treatment or outcome density, distance or the number of treated social network links; and vaccine efficacy parameters related to spillovers. We draw on high quality empirical examples to illustrate each of these parameters. We describe study designs to estimate spillovers and assumptions required to make causal inferences about spillovers. We aim to advance and encourage methods for spillover estimation and reporting by standardizing spillover parameter nomenclature and articulating the causal inference assumptions required to estimate spillovers.},

Considerable evidence suggests that reporting of harms-related data from RCTs also needs improvement. Members of the CONSORT Group, including journal editors and scientists, met in Montebello, Quebec, Canada, in May 2003 to address this problem. The result is the following document: the standard CONSORT checklist with 10 new recommendations about reporting harms-related issues, accompanying explanation, and examples to highlight specific aspects of proper reporting. We hope that this document, in conjunction with other CONSORT-related materials (http://www.consort-statement.org), will help authors improve their reporting of harms-related data from RCTs.

	abstract = {The problem of collecting, analysing and evaluating evidence on adverse drug reactions is an example of the more general class of epistemological problems related to scientiﬁc inference and prediction, as well as a central problem of health care practice. Philosophical discussions have analysed critically the methodological pitfalls and epistemological implications of evidence assessment in medicine; however, they have focused predominantly on evidence of treatment efﬁcacy. Most of this work is devoted to statistical methods of causal inference with a special focus on the privileged role assigned to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in evidence-based medicine. Regardless of whether the RCT’s privilege holds for efﬁcacy assessment, it is nevertheless important to make a distinction between causal inference in relation to intended and unintended effects, in that the unknowns at stake are heterogeneous in the two contexts. This point has been emphasized by epidemiologists in the last decade. Their primary focus is methodological and regards the fact that bias and confounding factors do not affect studies on intended and unintended effects in the same way. However, deeper concerns ground the intuition for such a distinction; these are related to the constraints we impose on evidence and their epistemological justiﬁcation. My thesis is that such constraints ought to be understood as being different in evidence for risk versus for efﬁcacy. I present the recent debate on the causal association between acetaminophen and asthma in order to illustrate the point at issue. The upshot of my analysis is that different epistemologies confer different methodological choices, which in turn bring about relevant practical implications such as the decision to restrict or suspend drug use rather than leaving it on the market. Thus, it is worth considering the criteria underlying our evidence constraints because they may be ill suited to the purpose for which they are used.},

	abstract = {Objective To examine the design characteristics, risk of bias, and reporting adequacy of pivotal randomised controlled trials of cancer drugs approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
Design Cross sectional analysis.
Setting European regulatory documents, clinical trial registry records, protocols, journal publications, and supplementary appendices.
Eligibility criteria Pivotal randomised controlled trials of new cancer drugs approved by the EMA between 2014 and 2016.
Main outcome measures Study design characteristics (randomisation, comparators, and endpoints); risk of bias using the revised Cochrane tool (bias arising from the randomisation process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, and selection of the reported result); and reporting adequacy (completeness and consistency of information in trial protocols, publications, supplementary appendices, clinical trial registry records, and regulatory documents).
Results Between 2014 and 2016, the EMA approved 32 new cancer drugs on the basis of 54 pivotal studies. Of these, 41 (76\%) were randomised controlled trials and 13 (24\%) were either non-randomised studies or single arm studies. 39/41 randomised controlled trials had available publications and were included in our study. Only 10 randomised controlled trials (26\%) measured overall survival as either a primary or coprimary endpoint, with the remaining trials evaluating surrogate measures such as progression free survival and response rates. Overall, 19 randomised controlled trials (49\%) were judged to be at high risk of bias for their primary outcome. Concerns about missing outcome data (n=10) and measurement of the outcome (n=7) were the most common domains leading to high risk of bias judgments. Fewer randomised controlled trials that evaluated overall survival as the primary endpoint were at high risk of bias than those that evaluated surrogate efficacy endpoints (2/10 (20\%) v 16/29 (55\%), respectively). When information available in regulatory documents and the scientific literature was considered separately, overall risk of bias judgments differed for eight randomised controlled trials (21\%), which reflects reporting inadequacies in both sources of information. Regulators identified additional deficits beyond the domains captured in risk of bias assessments for 10 drugs (31\%). These deficits included magnitude of clinical benefit, inappropriate comparators, and non-preferred study endpoints, which were not disclosed as limitations in scientific publications.
Conclusions Most pivotal studies forming the basis of EMA approval of new cancer drugs between 2014 and 2016 were randomised controlled trials. However, almost half of these were judged to be at high risk of bias based on their design, conduct, or analysis, some of which might be unavoidable because of the complexity of cancer trials. Regulatory documents and the scientific literature had gaps in their reporting. Journal publications did not acknowledge the key limitations of the available evidence identified in regulatory documents.},

Because Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of most new drugs requires demonstrating efficacy and safety against placebo, there is limited interest by manufacturers in conducting such head-to-head trials. Comparative effectiveness research seeks to provide head-to-head comparisons of treatment outcomes in routine care. Health-care utilization databases record drug use and selected health outcomes for large populations in a timely way and reflect routine care, and therefore may be the preferred data source for comparative effectiveness research. Confounding caused by selective prescribing based on indication, severity, and prognosis threatens the validity of non-randomized database studies that often have limited details on clinical information. Several recent developments may bring the field closer to acceptable validity, including approaches that exploit the concepts of proxy variables using high-dimensional propensity scores, within-patient variation of drug exposure using crossover designs, and between-provider variation in prescribing preference using instrumental variable (IV) analyses.},

Baseline measurements are common in trials of chronic conditions where researchers want to see whether a treatment can reduce pre-existing levels of pain, anxiety, hypertension, and the like.

Statistical comparisons in such trials can be made in several ways. Comparison of follow up (post-treatment) scores will give a result such as “at the end of the trial, mean pain scores were 15 mm (95\% confidence interval 10 to 20 mm) lower in the treatment group.” Alternatively a change score can be calculated by subtracting the follow up score from the baseline score, leading to a statement such as “pain reductions were 20 mm (16 to 24 mm) greater on treatment than control.” If the average baseline scores are the same in each group the estimated treatment effect will be the same using these two simple approaches. If the treatment is effective the statistical significance of the treatment effect by the two methods will depend on the correlation between baseline and follow up scores.

The simplest approach to evaluating a new treatment is to compare a single group of patients given the new treatment with a group previously treated with an alternative treatment. Usually such studies compare two consecutive series of patients in the same hospital(s). This approach is seriously flawed. Problems will arise from the mixture of retrospective and prospective studies, and we can never satisfactorily eliminate possible biases due to other factors (apart from treatment) that may have changed over time. Sacks et al compared trials of the same treatments in which randomised or historical controls were used and found a consistent tendency for historically controlled trials to yield more optimistic results than randomised trials.2 The use of historical controls can be justified only in tightly controlled situations of relatively rare conditions, such …},

Recent methodologic analyses indicate that inadequate reporting and design are associated with biased estimates of treatment effects. Such systematic error is seriously damaging to RCTs, which boast the elimination of systematic error as their primary hallmark. Systematic error in RCTs reflects poor science, and poor science threatens proper ethical standards. A group of scientists and editors developed the CONSORT (Con solidated S tandards o f R eporting T rials) statement to improve the quality of reporting of RCTs. The statement consists of a checklist and flow diagram that authors can use for reporting an RCT. Many leading medical journals and major international editorial groups have adopted the CONSORT statement. The CONSORT statement facilitates critical appraisal and interpretation of RCTs by providing guidance to authors about how to improve the reporting of their trials. This explanatory and elaboration document is intended to enhance the use, understanding, and dissemination of the CONSORT statement. The meaning and rationale for each checklist item are presented. For most items, at least one published example of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies are provided. Several examples of flow diagrams are included.

	abstract = {Background Risk factors for birth defects are frequently investigated using data limited to liveborn infants. By conditioning on survival, results of such studies may be distorted by selection bias, also described as “livebirth bias.” However, the implications of livebirth bias on risk estimation remain poorly understood. Objectives We sought to quantify livebirth bias and to investigate the conditions under which it arose. Methods We used data on 3994 birth defects cases and 11 829 controls enrolled in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study to compare odds ratio (OR) estimates of the relationship between three established risk factors (antiepileptic drug use, smoking, and multifetal pregnancy) and four birth defects (anencephaly, spina bifida, omphalocele, and cleft palate) when restricted to livebirths as compared to among livebirths, stillbirths, and elective terminations. Exposures and birth defects represented varying strengths of association with livebirth; all controls were liveborn. We performed a quantitative bias analysis to evaluate the sensitivity of our results to excluding terminated and stillborn controls. Results Cases ranged from 33\% liveborn (anencephaly) to 99\% (cleft palate). Smoking and multifetal pregnancy were associated with livebirth among anencephaly (crude OR [cOR] 0.61 and cOR 3.15, respectively) and omphalocele cases (cOR 2.22 and cOR 5.22, respectively). For analyses of the association between exposures and birth defects, restricting to livebirths produced negligible differences in estimates except for anencephaly and multifetal pregnancy, which was twofold higher among livebirths (adjusted OR [aOR] 4.93) as among all pregnancy outcomes (aOR 2.44). Within tested scenarios, bias analyses suggested that results were not sensitive to the restriction to liveborn controls. Conclusions Selection bias was generally limited except for high mortality defects in the context of exposures strongly associated with livebirth. Findings indicate that substantial livebirth bias is unlikely to affect studies of risk factors for most birth defects.},

Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA. Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37–75]). The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5·2 log$_{\textrm{10}}$ copies per mL (IQR 4·1–7·0). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope −0·15, 95\% CI −0·19 to −0·11; \textit{R}$^{\textrm{2}}$=0·71). In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's ρ=0·48, 95\% CI 0·074–0·75; p=0·020). For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94\% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88\% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100\% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94\% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15). Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre (\textit{R}$^{\textrm{2}}${\textgreater}0·9). No genome mutations were detected on serial samples.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic. This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals.

	abstract = {Mathematical models can aid in the understanding of the risks associated with the global spread of infectious diseases. To assess the current state of mathematical models for the global spread of infectious diseases, we reviewed the literature highlighting common approaches and good practice, and identifying research gaps. We followed a scoping study method and extracted information from 78 records on: modelling approaches; input data (epidemiological, population, and travel) for model parameterization; model validation data. We found that most epidemiological data come from published journal articles, population data come from a wide range of sources, and travel data mainly come from statistics or surveys, or commercial datasets. The use of commercial datasets may benefit the modeller, however makes critical appraisal of their model by other researchers more difficult. We found a minority of records (26) validated their model. We posit that this may be a result of pandemics, or far-reaching epidemics, being relatively rare events compared with other modelled physical phenomena (e.g. climate change). The sparsity of such events, and changes in outbreak recording, may make identifying suitable validation data difficult. We appreciate the challenge of modelling emerging infections given the lack of data for both model parameterisation and validation, and inherent complexity of the approaches used. However, we believe that open access datasets should be used wherever possible to aid model reproducibility and transparency. Further, modellers should validate their models where possible, or explicitly state why validation was not possible.},

We fitted the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in an age-structured epidemic framework and investigated the age distribution of cases. We also simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak (at the beginning of March or April).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Our projections show that physical distancing measures were most effective if the staggered return to work was at the beginning of April; this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92\% (IQR 66–97) and 24\% (13–90) in mid-2020 and end-2020, respectively. There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of delaying and reducing the height of the peak, median epidemic size at end-2020, and affording health-care systems more time to expand and respond.

We analyze the accuracy of different methods for estimating the transmission rate. We use data from the two simulation models and vary the sampling intervals and the size of the population sampled. We devise two new methods to determine transmission rate, and compare these to the frequently used Poisson regression method in both epidemic and endemic situations. For most tested scenarios these new methods perform similar or better than Poisson regression, especially in the case of long sampling intervals. We conclude that transmission rate estimates are easily biased, which is important to take into account when using these rates in simulation models.},

	abstract = {Background
The potential impact of an influenza pandemic can be assessed by calculating a set of transmissibility parameters, the most important being the reproduction number (R), which is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated per typical infectious case.

Methods
We conducted a systematic review to summarize published estimates of R for pandemic or seasonal influenza and for novel influenza viruses (e.g. H5N1). We retained and summarized papers that estimated R for pandemic or seasonal influenza or for human infections with novel influenza viruses.

Results
The search yielded 567 papers. Ninety-one papers were retained, and an additional twenty papers were identified from the references of the retained papers. Twenty-four studies reported 51 R values for the 1918 pandemic. The median R value for 1918 was 1.80 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.47–2.27). Six studies reported seven 1957 pandemic R values. The median R value for 1957 was 1.65 (IQR: 1.53–1.70). Four studies reported seven 1968 pandemic R values. The median R value for 1968 was 1.80 (IQR: 1.56–1.85). Fifty-seven studies reported 78 2009 pandemic R values. The median R value for 2009 was 1.46 (IQR: 1.30–1.70) and was similar across the two waves of illness: 1.46 for the first wave and 1.48 for the second wave. Twenty-four studies reported 47 seasonal epidemic R values. The median R value for seasonal influenza was 1.28 (IQR: 1.19–1.37). Four studies reported six novel influenza R values. Four out of six R values were {\textless}1.

Conclusions
These R values represent the difference between epidemics that are controllable and cause moderate illness and those causing a significant number of illnesses and requiring intensive mitigation strategies to control. Continued monitoring of R during seasonal and novel influenza outbreaks is needed to document its variation before the next pandemic.

	abstract = {Background
18 500 laboratory-confirmed deaths caused by the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 were reported worldwide for the period April, 2009, to August, 2010. This number is likely to be only a fraction of the true number of the deaths associated with 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1. We aimed to estimate the global number of deaths during the first 12 months of virus circulation in each country.
Methods
We calculated crude respiratory mortality rates associated with the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 strain by age (0–17 years, 18–64 years, and {\textgreater}64 years) using the cumulative (12 months) virus-associated symptomatic attack rates from 12 countries and symptomatic case fatality ratios (sCFR) from five high-income countries. To adjust crude mortality rates for differences between countries in risk of death from influenza, we developed a respiratory mortality multiplier equal to the ratio of the median lower respiratory tract infection mortality rate in each WHO region mortality stratum to the median in countries with very low mortality. We calculated cardiovascular disease mortality rates associated with 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 infection with the ratio of excess deaths from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases during the pandemic in five countries and multiplied these values by the crude respiratory disease mortality rate associated with the virus. Respiratory and cardiovascular mortality rates associated with 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 were multiplied by age to calculate the number of associated deaths.
Findings
We estimate that globally there were 201 200 respiratory deaths (range 105 700–395 600) with an additional 83 300 cardiovascular deaths (46 000–179 900) associated with 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1. 80\% of the respiratory and cardiovascular deaths were in people younger than 65 years and 51\% occurred in southeast Asia and Africa.
Interpretation
Our estimate of respiratory and cardiovascular mortality associated with the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 was 15 times higher than reported laboratory-confirmed deaths. Although no estimates of sCFRs were available from Africa and southeast Asia, a disproportionate number of estimated pandemic deaths might have occurred in these regions. Therefore, efforts to prevent influenza need to effectively target these regions in future pandemics.

	abstract = {Background During the influenza pandemic of 2009 estimates of symptomatic and asymptomatic infection were needed to guide vaccination policies and inform other control measures. Serological studies are the most reliable way to measure influenza infection independent of symptoms. We reviewed all published serological studies that estimated the cumulative incidence of infection with pandemic influenza H1N1 2009 prior to the initiation of population-based vaccination against the pandemic strain. Methodology and Principal Findings We searched for studies that estimated the cumulative incidence of pandemic influenza infection in the wider community. We excluded studies that did not include both pre- and post-pandemic serological sampling and studies that included response to vaccination. We identified 47 potentially eligible studies and included 12 of them in the review. Where there had been a significant first wave, the cumulative incidence of pandemic influenza infection was reported in the range 16\%–28\% in pre-school aged children, 34\%–43\% in school aged children and 12\%–15\% in young adults. Only 2\%–3\% of older adults were infected. The proportion of the entire population infected ranged from 11\%–18\%. We re-estimated the cumulative incidence to account for the small proportion of infections that may not have been detected by serology, and performed direct age-standardisation to the study population. For those countries where it could be calculated, this suggested a population cumulative incidence in the range 11\%–21\%. Conclusions and Significance Around the world, the cumulative incidence of infection (which is higher than the cumulative incidence of clinical disease) was below that anticipated prior to the pandemic. Serological studies need to be routine in order to be sufficiently timely to provide support for decisions about vaccination.},

	abstract = {An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout China and received worldwide attention. On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century. As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 2977 deaths (3.4\%) had been reported by WHO. Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to β-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host. The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract. Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms. The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation. In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.},

	abstract = {The present outbreak of a coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is the third documented spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans in only two decades that has resulted in a major epidemic. The Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family Coronaviridae, has assessed the placement of the human pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the Coronaviridae. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and designates it as SARS-CoV-2. In order to facilitate communication, the CSG proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/host/location/isolate/date. While the full spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined, the independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying viruses at the species level to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance. This will improve our understanding of virus–host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks.},

We examined the evolutionary relationships between bat CoVs and their hosts by using sequence data of the virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene and the bat cytochrome b gene. Phylogenetic analyses showed multiple incongruent associations between the phylogenies of rhinolophid bats and their CoVs, which suggested that host shifts have occurred in the recent evolutionary history of this group. These shifts may be due to either virus biologic traits or host behavioral traits. This finding has implications for the emergence of SARS and for the potential future emergence of SARS-CoVs or related viruses.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical developmental disability in childhood with a prevalence of 2 to 3 per 1000 live births. beta2-adrenoreceptor agonist (beta2AA) are widely used for the treatment of asthma. Maternal use of beta2AAs may increase the risk of adverse neuro-psychiatric health outcomes in the offspring. No study, however, has evaluated the effect of prenatal exposure to beta2AAs on the risk of CP. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between prenatal exposure to beta2AAs and the risk of childhood cerebral palsy. METHODS: This population-based cohort study included all live singleton births in Denmark from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2003. The information on outpatient prescriptions of beta2AAs was extracted from Danish National Prescription Registry. Children born to mothers who used beta2AAs from 30 days before pregnancy until delivery were categorized as the exposed. To differentiate the effect of beta2AAs from the underlying indications, the exposure window was further extended to 2 years before pregnancy and the exposed groups were re-defined to represent different periods of exposure to maternal use of beta2AAs (use only before pregnancy, use only during pregnancy, and use both before and during pregnancy). Cases of CP were identified from the Danish Cerebral Palsy Register. Logistic regression was used to estimate incidence odds ratio (OR) of CP. RESULTS: Among all the 442,278 singletons, 19,616 (4.44\%) were exposed to beta2AAs in utero (from 30 days before pregnancy until delivery). The risk of childhood CP was 0.21\% in exposed and 0.19\% in unexposed group, yielding an adjusted OR (aOR) 1.12 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.82, 1.53). When extending the exposure time window to 2 years prior to pregnancy, no overall significant association was observed regardless of the exposure period. However, an increased risk of CP (aOR = 1.41, 95\%CI: 0.92, 2.18) for maternal beta2AAs use during pregnancy was observed in female offspring, especially in those born at term (aOR = 1.65, 95\%CI: 1.02, 2.67). This increase was mainly attributed to an increased risk in those born to mothers who used beta2AAs both before and during pregnancy (aOR = 1.81, 95\%CI: 0.99, 3.33). CONCLUSIONS: We observed an association between maternal beta2AAs use during pregnancy and an increased risk of CP in female offspring, but we could not rule out confounding by the underlying indications for beta2AAs.},

These lesions are known to increase the risk of cerebral palsy (CP). Thus, we wanted to examine the long-term risk of CP following IRDS in moderately late and late preterm infants.
Design Population-based cohort study.
Setting All hospitals in Denmark.
Participants We used nationwide medical registries to identify a cohort of all moderately and late preterm infants (defined as birth during 32–36 full gestational weeks) born in Denmark in 1997–2007 with and without hospital diagnosed IRDS.
Main outcomes measures We followed study participants from birth until first diagnosis of CP, emigration, death or end of follow-up in 2014. We computed the cumulative incidence of CP before age 8 years and used Cox's regression analysis to compute HRs of IRDS, comparing children with IRDS to those without IRDS. HRs were adjusted for multiple covariates.
Results We identified 39 420 moderately late and late preterm infants, of whom 2255 (5.7\%) had IRDS. The cumulative incidence of CP was 1.9\% in infants with IRDS and 0.5\% in the comparison cohort. The adjusted HR of CP was 2.0 (95\% CI 1.4 to 2.9). The adjusted HR of CP was 12 (95\% CI 4.5 to 34) in children with IRDS accompanied by a diagnosis of ICH/IVH. After restriction to children without diagnoses of perinatal breathing disorders other than IRDS, congenital heart disease and viral or bacterial infections occurring within 4 days of birth, the overall adjusted HR was 2.1 (95\% CI 1.4 to 3.1).
Conclusions The risk of CP was increased in moderately late and late preterm infants with IRDS compared with infants without IRDS born during the same gestational weeks.},

	abstract = {Background:
Pediatric seizures have been linked to psychiatric disorders in childhood, but there is a lack of large-scale population-based studies of psychiatric comorbidity in later life. This study examines the relation between childhood seizures and the risk of psychiatric disorders in adolescence and early adulthood.

Methods:
We carried out a register-based cohort study of all individuals born in Denmark in 1978–2002. Using diagnostic information from the Danish National Patient Register, all cohort members were categorized according to occurrence of febrile seizures and epilepsy, prior to entering follow-up on the child’s 10th birthday. The children were followed until onset of mental illness, death, emigration, or the end of the study period on December 31, 2012. Cox regression analyses were used to estimate the risk of five pre-defined groups of psychiatric disorders (substance abuse disorders, schizophrenia, mood disorder, anxiety, and personality disorder), separately and combined. The models were adjusted for relevant confounders.

Findings:
We followed 1,291,679 individuals, including 43,148 with febrile seizures, 10,355 with epilepsy, and 1,696 with both, for a total of {\textasciitilde}15 million person years and identified 83,735 cohort members with at least one of the psychiatric disorders of interest. The risk of any psychiatric disorder was elevated in individuals with a history of febrile seizures (hazards ratio (HR): 1.12, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.08–1.17), with epilepsy (HR: 1.34, 95\% CI: 1.25–1.44), and with both (HR: 1.50, 95\% CI: 1.28–1.75). Excess risk of psychiatric illness associated with childhood seizures was present across a range of different disorders, most notably schizophrenia, but also anxiety and mood disorders. The associations did not differ between males and females (p-value: p=0.30), but increased with increasing numbers of hospitalizations for febrile seizures (p-value {\textless} 0.001) and with later onset of childhood epilepsy (p-value {\textless}0.001).

Interpretation:
Children with epilepsy as well as febrile seizures - with and without concomitant epilepsy - are at elevated risk of developing a broad range of psychiatric disorders in later life. Clarification of the underlying mechanisms responsible for these associations are needed to identify potentials for prevention.

	abstract = {Abstract
          The pandemic caused by emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 presents a serious global public health emergency in urgent need of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry depends on binding between the viral Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) target cell receptor. Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of 206 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from single B cells of eight SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. These mAbs come from diverse families of antibody heavy and light chains without apparent enrichment for particular families in the repertoire. In samples from one patient selected for further analyses, we found coexistence of germline and germline divergent clones. Both clone types demonstrated impressive binding and neutralizing activity against pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2. However, the antibody neutralizing potency is determined by competition with ACE2 receptor for RBD binding. Surprisingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies nor the infected plasma cross-reacted with RBDs from either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV although substantial plasma cross-reactivity to the trimeric Spike proteins from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was found. These results suggest that antibody response to RBDs is viral species-specific while that cross-recognition target regions outside the RBD. The specificity and neutralizing characteristics of this plasma cross-reactivity requires further investigation. Nevertheless, the diverse and potent neutralizing antibodies identified here are promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic SARS-CoV-2 interventions.},

These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Using data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17·8 days (95\% credible interval [CrI] 16·9–19·2) and to hospital discharge to be 24·7 days (22·9–28·1). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70 117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3·67\% (95\% CrI 3·56–3·80). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1·38\% (1·23–1·53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0·32\% [0·27–0·38] in those aged {\textless}60 years \textit{vs} 6·4\% [5·7–7·2] in those aged ≥60 years), up to 13·4\% (11·2–15·9) in those aged 80 years or older.

Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66\% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age.

	abstract = {Background
During the 2009 influenza pandemic, uncertainty surrounding the seriousness of human infections with the H1N1pdm09 virus hindered appropriate public health response. One measure of seriousness is the case fatality risk, defined as the probability of mortality among people classified as cases.

Methods
We conducted a systematic review to summarize published estimates of the case fatality risk of the pandemic influenza H1N1pdm09 virus. Only studies that reported population-based estimates were included.

Results
We included 77 estimates of the case fatality risk from 50 published studies, about one-third of which were published within the first 9 months of the pandemic. We identified very substantial heterogeneity in published estimates, ranging from less than 1 to more than 10,000 deaths per 100,000 cases or infections. The choice of case definition in the denominator accounted for substantial heterogeneity, with the higher estimates based on laboratory-confirmed cases (point estimates= 0–13,500 per 100,000 cases) compared with symptomatic cases (point estimates= 0–1,200 per 100,000 cases) or infections (point estimates=1–10 per 100,000 infections). Risk based on symptomatic cases increased substantially with age.

Conclusions
Our review highlights the difficulty in estimating the seriousness of infection with a novel influenza virus using the case fatality risk. In addition, substantial variability in age-specific estimates complicates the interpretation of the overall case fatality risk and comparisons among populations. A consensus is needed on how to define and measure the seriousness of infection before the next pandemic.},

	abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) originated in Southern China in November 2002, and was brought to Hong Kong in February 2003. From Hong Kong, the disease spread rapidly worldwide but mostly to Asian countries. At the end of the epidemic in June, the global cumulative total was 8422 cases with 916 deaths (case fatality rate of 11\%). People of all ages were affected, but predominantly females. Health care workers were at high risk and accounted for one-fifth of all cases. Risk factors for death included old age and comorbid illnesses, especially diabetes. The disease is caused by a novel coronavirus and is transmitted by droplets or direct inoculation from contact with infected surfaces. Contaminated sewage was found to be responsible for the outbreak in a housing estate in Hong Kong affecting over 300 residents. The mean incubation period was 6.4 days (range 2–10). The duration between onset of symptoms and hospitalisation was from 3 to 5 days. The relatively prolonged incubation period allowed asymptomatic air travellers to spread the disease globally. The number of individuals infected by each case has been estimated to be 2.7. Effective control of nosocomial transmission included early detection of disease, strict isolation of patients, practice of droplet and contact precautions and compliance with the use of personal protective equipment. Effective control of disease spread in the community included tracing and quarantine of contacts. Development of a validated diagnostic test and an effective vaccine as well as elimination of possible animal reservoirs are measures needed to prevent another epidemic.},

The transmission rate and isolation effectiveness have the largest fractional effect on R0. We estimated the distribution of the reproductive number R0 under perfect isolation conditions. The distribution lies in the interquartile range 0.19–1.08, with a median of 0.49. Even though the median of R0 is {\textless}1, we found that 25\% of our R0 distribution lies at R0 {\textgreater} 1, even with perfect isolation.

	abstract = {Estimating the case-fatality risk (CFR)—the probability that a person dies from an infection given that they are a case—is a high priority in epidemiologic investigation of newly emerging infectious diseases and sometimes in new outbreaks of known infectious diseases. The data available to estimate the overall CFR are often gathered for other purposes (e.g., surveillance) in challenging circumstances. We describe two forms of bias that may affect the estimation of the overall CFR—preferential ascertainment of severe cases and bias from reporting delays—and review solutions that have been proposed and implemented in past epidemics. Also of interest is the estimation of the causal impact of specific interventions (e.g., hospitalization, or hospitalization at a particular hospital) on survival, which can be estimated as a relative CFR for two or more groups. When observational data are used for this purpose, three more sources of bias may arise: confounding, survivorship bias, and selection due to preferential inclusion in surveillance datasets of those who are hospitalized and/or die. We illustrate these biases and caution against causal interpretation of differential CFR among those receiving different interventions in observational datasets. Again, we discuss ways to reduce these biases, particularly by estimating outcomes in smaller but more systematically defined cohorts ascertained before the onset of symptoms, such as those identified by forward contact tracing. Finally, we discuss the circumstances in which these biases may affect non-causal interpretation of risk factors for death among cases.},

We report the effects of treatment with canagliflozin on cardiovascular, renal, and safety outcomes. Methods The CANVAS Program integrated data from two trials involving a total of 10,142 participants with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. Participants in each trial were randomly assigned to receive canagliflozin or placebo and were followed for a mean of 188.2 weeks. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Results The mean age of the participants was 63.3 years, 35.8\% were women, the mean duration of diabetes was 13.5 years, and 65.6\% had a history of cardiovascular disease. The rate of the primary outcome was lower with canagliflozin than with placebo (occurring in 26.9 vs. 31.5 participants per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio, 0.86; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.97; P{\textless}0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.02 for superiority). Although on the basis of the prespecified hypothesis testing sequence the renal outcomes are not viewed as statistically significant, the results showed a possible benefit of canagliflozin with respect to the progression of albuminuria (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.67 to 0.79) and the composite outcome of a sustained 40\% reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate, the need for renal-replacement therapy, or death from renal causes (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.47 to 0.77). Adverse reactions were consistent with the previously reported risks associated with canagliflozin except for an increased risk of amputation (6.3 vs. 3.4 participants per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio, 1.97; 95\% CI, 1.41 to 2.75); amputations were primarily at the level of the toe or metatarsal. Conclusions In two trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes and an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, patients treated with canagliflozin had a lower risk of cardiovascular events than those who received placebo but a greater risk of amputation, primarily at the level of the toe or metatarsal.

	abstract = {Purpose
We describe a method for testing and estimating a two-way additive interaction between two categorical variables, each of which has greater than or equal to two levels.
Methods
We test additive and multiplicative interactions in the same proportional hazards model and measure additivity by relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), proportion of disease attributable to interaction (AP), and synergy index (S). A simulation study was used to compare the performance of these measures of additivity. Data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort study with a total of 15,792 subjects were used to exemplify the methods.
Results
The test and measures of departure from additivity depend neither on follow-up time nor on the covariates. The simulation study indicates that RERI is the best choice of measures of additivity using a proportional hazards model. The examples indicated that an interaction between two variables can be statistically significant on additive measure (RERI = 1.14, p = 0.04) but not on multiplicative measure (β3 = 0.59, p = 0.12) and that additive and multiplicative interactions can be in opposite directions (RERI = 0.08, β3 = –0.08).
Conclusions
The method has broader application for any regression models with a rate as the dependent variable. In the case that both additive and multiplicative interactions are statistically significant and in the opposite direction, the interpretation needs caution.},

Further results are given that allow for assessing the range of times and baseline survival probabilities for which parameter estimates indicate that a causal interaction is present, and for deriving lower bounds on the prevalence of such causal interactions. An interesting feature of the time-to-event setting is that causal interactions can disappear as time progresses i.e. whether a causal interaction is present depends on the follow-up time. The results are illustrated by hypothetical and data analysis examples.},

	abstract = {Background
The per-protocol effect provides important information in randomized trials with incomplete adherence. Yet, because valid estimation typically requires adjustment for prognostic factors that predict adherence, per-protocol effect estimates are often met with skepticism. In placebo-controlled trials, however, the validity of adjustment can be indirectly verified by demonstrating no association between adherence and the outcome among the placebo arm. Here, we describe a two-stage procedure in which we first adjust for time-varying adherence in the placebo arm and then use a similar procedure to estimate the per-protocol effect.
Methods
We use the Candesartan in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity (CHARM) randomized trial. First, we compare adherers versus non-adherers in the placebo arm, adjusting for pre- and post-randomization variables. Second, we use models validated in the placebo arm to estimate the per-protocol effect of adherence to candesartan versus placebo in the full trial.
Findings
We successfully estimated no association between adherence and mortality in the placebo arm; hazard ratio: 0.91 (95\% CI: 0.51, 2.52). We then estimated the per-protocol effect under two sets of protocol-defined stopping criteria after adjustment for post-randomization confounders. The mortality hazard ratio estimates ranged from 0.91 to 0.93 for the per-protocol effect estimates, similar to the intention-to-treat effect estimates.
Interpretation
Adherence adjustment in the CHARM trial is feasible when appropriate assumptions about missing data and confounding are made. These assumptions cannot be verified but can be supported through the use of placebo-arm adherence assessment.},

	abstract = {Objective
To identify factors associated with contraceptive uptake among participants in a miscarriage management clinical trial.
Study Design
We performed a secondary analysis of a multi-center, randomized controlled trial of medical management regimens for miscarriage between 5 and 12 completed weeks. Pregnancy intention was measured by patient report after miscarriage diagnosis. Participants were offered contraception in accordance with standard clinical care once their miscarriage was completed. We analyzed participants as a cohort and fit a multivariable model to describe demographic characteristics and pregnancy intentions independently associated with contraceptive uptake.
Results
Of 244 participants with available contraceptive outcomes, 121 (50\%) stated that this pregnancy was planned, and 218 (90\%) stated that they had planned to continue the pregnancy to term. Ninety-seven participants (40\%) initiated contraception: 33 (14\%) selected a long-acting reversible method, 44 (18\%) a short-acting reversible method, and 20 (8\%) condoms or emergency contraception, while 147 (60\%) declined contraception after miscarriage completion. In the multivariable model, unplanned pregnancy (aRR 2.13, 95\% CI: 1.45-3.13) and lack of intention to continue the pregnancy (aRR 1.61, 95\% CI: 1.18-2.20) were independently associated with contraceptive uptake. Of participants who declined contraception, 85 (57\%) did so in order to conceive again. Nearly one-quarter of participants who declined contraception described the index pregnancy as unplanned, but after miscarriage planned to conceive a new pregnancy.
Conclusion
Patients with unplanned pregnancy who miscarried were twice as likely to initiate contraception as those with planned pregnancy, however pregnancy intentions sometimes changed after miscarriage.
Implications
Miscarriage management represents an important opportunity to clarify pregnancy goals and provide contraceptive counseling. Although unplanned pregnancy correlates with contraceptive uptake, we do not recommend using this clinically to predict contraceptive need. Future research should examine how best to measure pregnancy intention and its relationship to the experience of miscarriage.},

Methods: Pregnancy cases with exposure to interferon beta-1b reported to Bayer's pharmacovigilance (PV) database from worldwide sources from January 1995 through February 2018 were retrieved for evaluation. Only cases where pregnancy outcomes were unknown at the time of reporting (i.e. prospective cases) were included in the analysis of this retrospective cohort study.
Results: As of February 2018, 2581 prospective pregnancies exposed to interferon beta-1b were retrieved from the database; 1348 pregnancies had documented outcomes. The majority of outcomes [1106 cases (82.0\%)] were live births. Health status was known for 981 live births (no known health status for 125). Most of the prospective pregnancies with known outcomes corresponded to live births with no congenital anomalies [896 cases (91.3\%)]. Spontaneous abortion occurred in 160 cases (11.9\%). Congenital birth defects were observed in 14/981 live births with known health status [1.4\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.78-2.38]. No consistent pattern in the type of birth defect was identified. Rates of both spontaneous abortion and birth defects were not higher than the general population.
Conclusions: These PV data, the largest sample of interferon beta-1b-exposed patients reported to date, suggest no increase in risk of spontaneous abortion or congenital anomalies in women exposed during pregnancy.},

In epidemiological research assessment of endpoints is often conducted via registers. In the present study we validated stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) diagnoses in the Danish National Register of Patients (DNRP). \textit{Methods:} Subjects from a Danish cohort study, the Copenhagen City Heart Study (n = 19,698), were crosslinked with the DNRP. The following International Classification of Disease 10th revision codes were used to identify possible strokes and TIAs: I60–I69 and G45. Two independent raters reviewed all cases. Positive predictive values of stroke, TIA and stroke subtypes were estimated by dividing the confirmed cases by the total number of cases located in the DNRP. Interrater reliability was tested using ĸ statistics.\textit{ Results:} Of 236 possible cerebrovascular events, 1 in 6 stroke diagnoses did not meet study criteria. The majority of events in the DNRP were registered as unspecified stroke (I64), n = 105 (44\%), of which two thirds were diagnosed as ischemic stroke events by the raters. Intracerebral hemorrhage and ischemic stroke had a positive predictive value from 74 to 97\%, respectively. \textit{Conclusion:} Our results show that the DNRP tends to overestimate the number of cerebrovascular events, while ischemic stroke is underestimated.},

	abstract = {Objective To evaluate the associations between maternal diabetes diagnosed before or during pregnancy and early onset cardiovascular disease (CVD) in offspring during their first four decades of life.
Design Population based cohort study.
Setting Danish national health registries.
Participants All 2 432 000 liveborn children without congenital heart disease in Denmark during 1977-2016. Follow-up began at birth and continued until first time diagnosis of CVD, death, emigration, or 31 December 2016, whichever came first.
Exposures for observational studies Pregestational diabetes, including type 1 diabetes (n=22 055) and type 2 diabetes (n=6537), and gestational diabetes (n=26 272).
Main outcome measures The primary outcome was early onset CVD (excluding congenital heart diseases) defined by hospital diagnosis. Associations between maternal diabetes and risks of early onset CVD in offspring were studied. Cox regression was used to assess whether a maternal history of CVD or maternal diabetic complications affected these associations. Adjustments were made for calendar year, sex, singleton status, maternal factors (parity, age, smoking, education, cohabitation, residence at childbirth, history of CVD before childbirth), and paternal history of CVD before childbirth. The cumulative incidence was averaged across all individuals, and factors were adjusted while treating deaths from causes other than CVD as competing events.
Results During up to 40 years of follow-up, 1153 offspring of mothers with diabetes and 91 311 offspring of mothers who did not have diabetes were diagnosed with CVD. Offspring of mothers with diabetes had a 29\% increased overall rate of early onset CVD (hazard ratio 1.29 (95\% confidence interval 1.21 to 1.37); cumulative incidence among offspring unexposed to maternal diabetes at 40 years of age 13.07\% (12.92\% to 13.21\%), difference in cumulative incidence between exposed and unexposed offspring 4.72\% (2.37\% to 7.06\%)). The sibship design yielded results similar to those of the unpaired design based on the whole cohort. Both pregestational diabetes (1.34 (1.25 to 1.43)) and gestational diabetes (1.19 (1.07 to 1.32)) were associated with increased rates of CVD in offspring. We also observed varied increased rates of specific early onset CVDs, particularly heart failure (1.45 (0.89 to 2.35)), hypertensive disease (1.78 (1.50 to 2.11)), deep vein thrombosis (1.82 (1.38 to 2.41)), and pulmonary embolism (1.91 (1.31 to 2.80)). Increased rates of CVD were seen in different age groups from childhood to early adulthood until age 40 years. The increased rates were more pronounced among offspring of mothers with diabetic complications (1.60 (1.25 to 2.05)). A higher incidence of early onset CVD in offspring of mothers with diabetes and comorbid CVD (1.73 (1.36 to 2.20)) was associated with the added influence of comorbid CVD but not due to the interaction between diabetes and CVD on the multiplicative scale (P value for interaction 0.94).
Conclusions Children of mothers with diabetes, especially those mothers with a history of CVD or diabetic complications, have increased rates of early onset CVD from childhood to early adulthood. If maternal diabetes does have a causal association with increased CVD rate in offspring, the prevention, screening, and treatment of diabetes in women of childbearing age could help to reduce the risk of CVD in the next generation.},

	abstract = {Purpose Antidepressants are the mainstay of pharmacological treatment for nonpsychotic mental disorders in the perinatal period. However, little is known about the indications for antidepressant use during pregnancy. We aimed to examine the treatment indications of antidepressant prescriptions redeemed by pregnant women and to investigate whether treatment indication patterns changed over time. Methods We conducted a population-based descriptive study using Danish national registers. We identified pregnancies resulting in live births between 2006 and 2016 from the Medical Birth Registry. We linked them to the National Prescription Registry to extract information on antidepressant prescriptions during pregnancy. We used generalized estimating equations to examine whether the indication patterns of antidepressants changed over time. Results A total of 47 093 antidepressant prescriptions associated with 17 170 pregnancies were identified. Overall, 82.3\% of pregnancies received antidepressant prescriptions for depression, including 9.2\% of pregnancies affected by comorbid indications, mainly anxiety disorders. In addition, 11.5\% of pregnancies received prescribed antidepressants for anxiety disorders only, 3.8\% for insomnia only, 0.5\% for anxiety and insomnia, and 1.9\% for other disorders. There was a small decrease in the percentage of antidepressant prescriptions for depression from 2006 to 2016, with an adjusted 1-year risk difference of −0.4\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], −0.7\% to −0.1\%), while the percentage for anxiety disorders increased, and the adjusted 1-year risk difference was 0.9\% (95\% CI, 0.7\% to 1.1\%). Conclusion The majority of antidepressant prescriptions in pregnancy are for depression treatment, which suggests that antidepressant prescription during pregnancy may be a suitable proxy for a depression diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Nonrandomized epidemiologic studies face many obstacles in attempting to quantify the effect of an exposure on an outcome. Studies of the associations between Parkinson’s disease and cancer may be particularly vulnerable to uncontrolled confounding, information bias, and selection bias. This dissertation provides graphical models and descriptions of how PD-cancer studies may be affected by biases. An overview is also provided of how investigators have attempted to control for these biases. A novel multiple bias modeling method called simultaneous multi-bias adjustment is developed to address this problem within a data fusion framework. Simulation studies are used to support the validity of this method and compare it to the more traditional approach of sequentially adjusting for multiple biases. Simultaneous multibias adjustment is then applied to study of the effect of PD on cancer in a  retrospective cohort study using Danish population registry data combined with behavioral information collected
from questionnaires and surveys. The observed effect of PD on overall cancer in this data set is approximately null. The effect estimate remains null after simultaneous multi-bias adjustment is applied, accounting for PD misclassification and selection bias related to participation and censoring. The simulation studies and Danish cohort study reveal  omputational and methodological challenges in performing simultaneous multi-bias adjustment. An interactive website and R package are developed to make this method more accessible to thers. By developing and demonstrating how to perform simultaneous multi-bias adjustment, showing its validity in simulated data, applying it to real-world data, and making tools for its usage, this dissertation aims to make multiple bias adjustment in causal modeling more accessible to other investigators.},

	abstract = {Objectives
The metabolic changes of pregnancy resemble a cardiovascular risk profile and may persist postpartum, with body mass index (BMI) as a potential modifier. We examined the association between the number of live-birth pregnancies and maternal premenopausal risks of hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for pre-pregnancy BMI as well as abortions and stillbirths.

Design
A prospective cohort study.

Setting
Mothers from the Danish National Birth Cohort (1996 to 2002). For each of these women, registry data on all pregnancies from 1973 to 2011 were obtained, as were self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and height.

Participants
A total of 44 552 first-time mothers in the Danish National Birth Cohort.

Outcome measures
Risks of hypertension and CVD during and between live-birth pregnancies separately and combined as live-birth cycles.

Results
After adjustment for abortions, stillbirths, pre-pregnancy BMI and other covariates, a higher risk of hypertension was observed in the first (HR 1.53, 95\% CI: 1.37 to 1.72) and fourth and subsequent live-birth cycles (HR 1.72, 95\% CI: 1.15 to 2.58), compared with the second. However, as number of live-birth pregnancies increased, risk of hypertension decreased during live-birth pregnancies and increased between live-birth pregnancies (tests for trend, p{\textless}0.01). For CVD, we found an overall J-shaped but non-significant association with number of live-birth pregnancies. No interaction with pre-pregnancy BMI ({\textless}25 versus ≥25 kg/m2) was observed.

Conclusions
Premenopausal women had the highest risk of hypertension and CVD during their first live-birth pregnancy and after their fourth live-birth pregnancy. All risks were independent of BMI before the first live-birth pregnancy and of number of abortions and stillbirths.},

Pregnancy losses may be associated with increased risks of dementia.

Methods
We conducted a register-based cohort study in 1,243,957 women with ≥1 pregnancy in Denmark in the period 1977–2015. Using Cox regression, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) comparing risks of dementia in women with and without pregnancy losses.

Results
During 21,672,433 person-years of follow-up, 261,279 women experienced a pregnancy loss, and 2188 women were diagnosed with dementia. Stillbirth was associated with an 86\% increased risk of dementia overall (HR 1.86, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.28–2.71). By contrast, miscarriage was not associated with later risk of dementia overall (single miscarriage, HR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.87–1.12; recurrent miscarriages, HR 1.06, 95\% CI 0.84–1.35). Adjustment for cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes did not meaningfully alter the association magnitudes.

Discussion
Stillbirth and dementia may share underlying mechanisms, suggesting that a history of stillbirth should be considered when assessing dementia risk in women.},

Electronic databases including MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched for English language articles published from 2000 to July 2016.

The risk is particularly greater in women with multiple miscarriages or stillbirths.

Setting and population Nurses’ Health Study II. Methods Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between first pregnancy outcome and hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. Main outcome measures Hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. Results Compared to women who reported a singleton live first birth, women with early spontaneous abortion ({\textless}12 weeks) had a greater rate of type 2 diabetes (HR: 1.20; 95\% CI: 1.07–1.34) and hypercholesterolemia (HR: 1.06; 95\% CI: 1.02–1.10), and a marginally increased rate of hypertension (HR: 1.05, 95\% CI: 1.00–1.11). Late spontaneous abortion (12–19 weeks) was associated with an increased rate of type 2 diabetes (HR: 1.38; 95\% CI: 1.14–1.65), hypercholesterolemia (HR: 1.11; 95\% CI: 1.03–1.19), and hypertension (HR: 1.15; 95\% CI: 1.05–1.25). The rates of type 2 diabetes (HR: 1.45; 95\% CI: 1.13–1.87) and hypertension (HR: 1.15; 95\% CI: 1.01–1.30) were higher in women who delivered stillbirth. In contrast, women whose first pregnancy ended in an induced abortion had lower rates of hypertension (HR: 0.87; 95\% CI: 0.84–0.91) and type 2 diabetes (HR: 0.89; 95\% CI: 0.79–0.99) than women with a singleton live birth. Conclusions Several types of pregnancy loss were associated with an increased rate of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, which may provide novel insight into the pathways through which pregnancy outcomes and CVD are linked.

	abstract = {Purpose Population-based data are sparse on utilization of prophylactic versus acute therapies for newly diagnosed migraine. We examined initial migraine treatment patterns and associated patient characteristics in Denmark. Methods We used population-based health databases to assemble a nationwide cohort of adult migraine patients in 2005 to 2013. Migraine was defined as a first hospital diagnosis of migraine or a second redeemed outpatient prescription for triptans, ergots, pizotifen, or flunarizine. We classified the initial migraine treatment received after migraine onset as “no treatment,” “acute only,” “prophylactic only,” and “both acute and prophylactic” and described distributions of sex, age, comorbidities, and comedications. Results Among 97 431 migraine patients (78\% women, median age of 41 y [interquartile range of 32-50 y]), the initial migraine treatments received were “acute only” (88.2\%), “prophylactic only” (1.9\%), and “both acute and prophylactic” (5.2\%) whereas 4.6\% had no record of treatment. Initiators of prophylactic treatment—with or without acute treatment—were less likely than initiators of acute treatment to be women (71\% and 77\% versus 79\%), were older (median ages: 45 and 44 y versus 41 y), and had more comorbidities (including hypertension [31\% and 24\% versus 7\%] and diabetes [6\% and 5\% versus 3\%]). Nonpersistence with initial prophylactic treatment was common: within the first year, 35\% of initiators stopped therapy fully, 50\% stopped and restarted, and 15\% switched drugs. Conclusions For 88\% of patients with incident migraine, the initial migraine treatment was acute treatment only. Use of prophylactic medication as initial treatment was low and correlated with higher age and comorbidity.},

We examined whether overweight and changes in weight status during childhood were associated with risk of VTE in adulthood. Methods and Results We used Danish medical registries to conduct a population-based cohort study of Danish schoolchildren aged 7 to 13 years and born during 1930-1989. We calculated body-mass index ( BMI ) z-scores based on weight and height measurements. We estimated hazard ratios using Cox regressions to examine associations between changes in BMI z-scores from 7 to 13 years of age and the subsequent risk of VTE . Among 313 998 children, 5007 girls and 5397 boys were diagnosed with VTE as adults. Compared with children with a normal BMI (25th to 75th percentile category) at both ages, children with a BMI persistently above the 75th percentile had a 1.30- to 1.50-fold increased risk of VTE in adulthood. Children who experienced a BMI increase from the 25th to 75th or {\textgreater}75th to 90th percentile to a higher percentile category had a 1.35- to 1.70-fold increased risk of adulthood VTE . Children whose BMI percentile category decreased between 7 and 13 years of age had a VTE risk similar to that of children with a persistently normal BMI . Conclusions Risk of VTE in adulthood was higher in children with a persistently above-average BMI . Whereas weight gain from 7 to 13 years of age additionally increased VTE risk, remission from overweight by 13 years of age completely reverted the risk.},

A systematic approach for the integration of causal modeling with statistical estimation is presented. We highlight some common points of confusion that occur when causal modeling techniques are applied in practice and provide a broad overview on the types of questions that a causal framework can help to address. Our aims are to argue for the utility of formal causal thinking, to clarify what causal models can and cannot do, and to provide an accessible introduction to the flexible and powerful tools provided by causal models.},

SETTING: Data from five previous population-based environmental studies of semen quality were combined into one database at a university hospital in Denmark. PATIENT(S): In total, 2,139 men provided data to the database. INTERVENTION(S): Data on semen and blood samples and information on lifestyle and reproductive factors, including body mass index (BMI), were collected.

RESULT(S): The T and inhibin B serum concentrations were 25\%-32\% lower in obese men in comparison with normal-weight men, whereas the E(2) concentration was 6\% higher in obese men. Overweight men (BMI, 25.1-30.0 kg/m(2)) had a slightly lower adjusted sperm concentration and total sperm count than did men with a normal BMI (20.0-25.0 kg/m(2)), but no reduction in sperm count was observed among the obese men.

	abstract = {A number of covariate-balancing methods, based on the propensity score, are widely used to estimate treatment effects in observational studies. If the treatment effect varies with the propensity score, however, different methods can give very different answers. The authors illustrate this effect by using data from a United Kingdom-based registry of subjects treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs for rheumatoid arthritis. Estimates of the effect of these drugs on mortality varied from a relative risk of 0.4 (95\% confidence interval: 0.16, 0.91) to a relative risk of 1.3 (95\% confidence interval: 0.8, 2.25), depending on the balancing method chosen. The authors show that these differences were due to a combination of an interaction between propensity score and treatment effect and to differences in weighting subjects with different propensity scores. Thus, the methods are being used to calculate average treatment effects in populations with very different distributions of effect-modifying variables, resulting in different overall estimates. This phenomenon highlights the importance of careful selection of the covariate-balancing method so that the overall estimate has a meaningful interpretation.},

	abstract = {The propensity score--the probability of exposure to a specific treatment conditional on observed variables--is increasingly being used in observational studies. Creating strata in which subjects are matched on the propensity score allows one to balance measured variables between treated and untreated subjects. There is an ongoing controversy in the literature as to which variables to include in the propensity score model. Some advocate including those variables that predict treatment assignment, while others suggest including all variables potentially related to the outcome, and still others advocate including only variables that are associated with both treatment and outcome. We provide a case study of the association between drug exposure and mortality to show that including a variable that is related to treatment, but not outcome, does not improve balance and reduces the number of matched pairs available for analysis. In order to investigate this issue more comprehensively, we conducted a series of Monte Carlo simulations of the performance of propensity score models that contained variables related to treatment allocation, or variables that were confounders for the treatment-outcome pair, or variables related to outcome or all variables related to either outcome or treatment or neither. We compared the use of these different propensity scores models in matching and stratification in terms of the extent to which they balanced variables. We demonstrated that all propensity scores models balanced measured confounders between treated and untreated subjects in a propensity-score matched sample. However, including only the true confounders or the variables predictive of the outcome in the propensity score model resulted in a substantially larger number of matched pairs than did using the treatment-allocation model. Stratifying on the quintiles of any propensity score model resulted in residual imbalance between treated and untreated subjects in the upper and lower quintiles. Greater balance between treated and untreated subjects was obtained after matching on the propensity score than after stratifying on the quintiles of the propensity score. When a confounding variable was omitted from any of the propensity score models, then matching or stratifying on the propensity score resulted in residual imbalance in prognostically important variables between treated and untreated subjects. We considered four propensity score models for estimating treatment effects: the model that included only true confounders; the model that included all variables associated with the outcome; the model that included all measured variables; and the model that included all variables associated with treatment selection. Reduction in bias when estimating a null treatment effect was equivalent for all four propensity score models when propensity score matching was used. Reduction in bias was marginally greater for the first two propensity score models than for the last two propensity score models when stratification on the quintiles of the propensity score model was employed. Furthermore, omitting a confounding variable from the propensity score model resulted in biased estimation of the treatment effect. Finally, the mean squared error for estimating a null treatment effect was lower when either of the first two propensity scores was used compared to when either of the last two propensity score models was used.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Evidence on the cardiotoxicity of nonaspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)-particularly diclofenac and the newer selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors-has accumulated over the last decade. Our objective was to examine whether the use of NSAIDs in the Nordic countries changed with the emerging evidence, regulatory statements, and clinical guidelines advocating caution for use of specific NSAIDs. DESIGN: Drug utilization study. DATA SOURCES: Nationwide wholesale statistics and prescription registries in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden (2000-2016). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Our main outcome measures were yearly total sales, expressed as number of sold defined daily doses (DDD)/1000 inhabitants/day, and yearly prevalence of prescription use, expressed as number of prescription users per 1000 inhabitants. The DDD is the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults. Total sales of NSAIDs increased in all countries and were highest in Iceland, with 74.3 DDDs/1000 inhabitants/day sold in 2016, followed by Finland (73.9), Sweden (54.4), Norway (43.8), and Denmark (31.8). Diclofenac use declined after 2008 in all countries but remained the most widely prescribed NSAID in Norway, with 63 prescription users/1000 inhabitants in 2016. Diclofenac sales also remained high in Iceland (12.7 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day), Norway (8.1), and Sweden (7.8). Since its introduction in 2003, the use of etoricoxib, a newer selective COX-2 inhibitor, increased in all countries except Denmark, with highest sales in Finland (6.7 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day in 2016). CONCLUSION: Sales and prescription patterns of NSAIDs in the Nordic countries has changed along with the accumulating evidence for the cardiovascular risks of specific NSAIDs. However, given existing evidence on the cardiovascular risks associated with use of diclofenac and etoricoxib, the persistent high use of diclofenac in Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, the persistent over-the-counter availability of diclofenac in Norway and Sweden, and the increasing use of etoricoxib in most of the Nordic countries pose a cardiovascular health concern.

Objective: To evaluate the association between ondansetron exposure during pregnancy and risk of congenital malformations. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study nested in the 2000-2013 nationwide Medicaid Analytic eXtract. The cohort consisted of 1816414 pregnancies contributed by 1502895 women enrolled in Medicaid from 3 months before the last menstrual period through 1 month or longer after delivery; infants were enrolled in Medicaid for at least 3 months after birth. The final date of follow-up was December 31, 2013. Analyses were conducted between November 1, 2017, and June 30, 2018. Propensity score stratification was used to control for treatment indication and other confounders. Exposures: Ondansetron dispensing during the first trimester, the period of organogenesis. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were cardiac malformations and oral clefts diagnosed during the first 90 days after delivery. Secondary outcomes included congenital malformations overall and subgroups of cardiac malformations and oral clefts. Results: Among 1816414 pregnancies (mean age of mothers, 24.3 [5.8] years), 88467 (4.9\%) were exposed to ondansetron during the first trimester. Overall, 14577 of 1727947 unexposed and 835 of 88467 exposed infants were diagnosed with a cardiac malformation, for an absolute risk of 84.4 (95\% CI, 83.0 to 85.7) and 94.4 (95\% CI, 88.0 to 100.8) per 10000 births respectively. The absolute risk of oral clefts was 11.1 per 10000 births (95\% CI, 10.6 to 11.6; 1921 unexposed infants) and was 14.0 per 10000 births (95\% CI, 11.6 to 16.5; 124 exposed infants). The risk of any congenital malformation was 313.5 per 10000 births (95\% CI, 310.9 to 316.1; 54174 unexposed infants) and was 370.4 (95\% CI, 358.0 to 382.9; 3277 exposed infants). The adjusted relative risk (RR) for cardiac malformations was 0.99 (95\% CI, 0.93 to 1.06) and the adjusted risk difference (RD) was -0.8 (95\% CI, -7.3 to 5.7 per 10000 births). For oral clefts, the adjusted RR was 1.24 (95\% CI, 1.03 to 1.48) and the RD was 2.7 (95\% CI, 0.2 to 5.2 per 10000 births). The adjusted estimate for congenital malformations overall was an RR of 1.01 (95\% CI, 0.98 to 1.05) and an RD of 5.4 (95\% CI, -7.3 to 18.2 per 10000 births). Conclusions and Relevance: Among offspring of mothers enrolled in Medicaid, first-trimester exposure to ondansetron was not associated with cardiac malformations or congenital malformations overall after accounting for measured confounders but was associated with a small increased risk of oral clefts.},

This population-based cohort study examined dementia among persons with a range of clinician-diagnosed stress disorders, and the interaction between stress disorders and sex in predicting dementia, in Denmark from 1995 to 2011. This study included Danes 40 years or older with a stress disorder diagnosis (n = 47,047) and a matched comparison cohort (n = 232,141) without a stress disorder diagnosis from 1995 through 2011. Diagnoses were culled from national registries. We used Cox proportional-hazards regression to estimate associations between stress disorders and dementia. Risk of dementia was higher for persons with stress disorders than for persons without such diagnosis; adjusted hazard ratios ranged from 1.6 to 2.8. There was evidence of an interaction between sex and stress disorders in predicting dementia, with a greater rate of dementia among men with stress disorders except posttraumatic stress disorder, for which women had a greater rate. Results support existing evidence of an association between stress and dementia.

	doi = {10.1093/humrep/dey372},
	abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: To what extent is cigarette smoking associated with reduced fecundability? SUMMARY ANSWER: Current female smokers, particularly those who had smoked {\textgreater}/=10 cigarettes/day for {\textgreater}/=10 years, had lower fecundability than never smokers, but current male smoking and passive smoking in either partner showed little association with reduced fecundability. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Female smoking has been identified as a cause of infertility, yet there has been limited characterization of the dose and duration at which an effect is observed. Results for male active smoking and passive smoking in both partners are less consistent. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We analyzed data from a North American internet-based preconception cohort study of 5473 female and 1411 male pregnancy planners, enrolled from 2013 to 2018. Participants had been attempting conception for {\textless}/=6 menstrual cycles at study entry. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We collected information on active and passive smoking history on baseline questionnaires. Pregnancy was reported on female bi-monthly follow-up questionnaires. We calculated fecundability ratios (FR) and 95\% CI using proportional probabilities regression models, adjusted for demographic, behavioral, medical, reproductive and dietary variables. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Female current regular smoking (FR = 0.90, 95\% CI: 0.77, 1.07), current occasional smoking (FR = 0.88, 95\% CI: 0.73, 1.06), and former smoking (FR = 0.89, 95\% CI: 0.81, 0.98) were associated with small reductions in fecundability. Results were stronger among women who smoked {\textgreater}/=10 cigarettes/day for {\textgreater}/=10 years (FR = 0.77, 95\% CI: 0.53, 1.10). Male current regular and former smoking, and current passive smoking in either partner were not meaningfully associated with reduced fecundability. In utero exposure to {\textgreater}/=10 cigarettes/day among females was associated with reduced fecundability (FR = 0.75, 95\% CI: 0.52, 1.06). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Numbers of cigarette smokers, particularly within categories of intensity and duration, were small. Under-reporting of smoking may have resulted in non-differential misclassification, and smokers were more likely to be lost to follow-up. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Given the consistency of our findings with results from previous studies and our observation of a dose-response relation in intensity of smoking, this study supports an association between female cigarette smoking and lower fecundability. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This study was funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (R01-HD086742, R21-HD072326, R03-HD090315 and T32-HD052458).

	abstract = {Purpose of review: Pharmacoepidemiologists are often interested in estimating the effects of dynamic treatment strategies, where treatments are modified based on patients' evolving characteristics. For such problems, appropriate control of both baseline and time-varying confounders is critical. Conventional methods that control confounding by including time-varying treatments and confounders in an outcome regression model may not have a causal interpretation, even when all baseline and time-varying confounders are measured. This problem occurs when time-varying confounders are, themselves, affected by past treatment. We review alternative analytic approaches that can produce valid inferences in the presence of such confounding. We focus on the parametric g-formula and inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models, two examples of Robins' g-methods. Recent findings: Unlike standard outcome regression methods, the parametric g-formula and inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models can estimate the effects of dynamic treatment strategies and appropriately control for measured time-varying confounders affected by prior treatment. Few applications of g-methods exist in the pharmacoepidemiology literature, primarily due to the common use of administrative claims data, which typically lack detailed measurements of time-varying information, and the limited availability of or familiarity with tools to help perform the relatively complex analysis. These barriers may be overcome with the increasing availability of data sources containing more detailed time-varying information and more accessible learning tools and software. Summary: With appropriate data and study design, g-methods can improve our ability to make causal inferences on dynamic treatment strategies from observational data in pharmacoepidemiology.},

METHODS: To investigate this possible association further, we have examined the outcome in 91 pregnancies in which the mother took either an ACE-I (n = 71) or an ARB (n = 20) in early pregnancy. We also examined the United Kingdom adverse drug reaction reporting system to assess the total number of reported associations of ACE-I or ARB use in pregnancy and congenital anomalies reported. RESULTS: Eight (8.8\%) of the pregnancies led to an infant with a developmental anomaly, but all save one of these (craniosynostosis with tower skull) anomalies were considered to be relatively minor. The adverse drug reaction reporting system revealed a total of 43 reported defects in women taking an ACE-I and 12 in women taking an ARB. CONCLUSION: We have not found any convincing excess of congenital anomalies in women taking angiotensin-blocking drugs in early pregnancy. However, this does not exclude the possibility that ACE-I or ARB use in pregnancy might lead to adverse obstetrical outcomes. Until this matter is settled, we support recommendations that these drugs should not be used in pregnancy or in women who are likely to become pregnant.},

However, the consequences of exposure during the first trimester are unclear, especially in diabetes. We report the experience from DIRECT (DIabetic REtinopathy and Candesartan Trials), three placebo-controlled studies designed to examine the effects of an ARB, candesartan, on diabetic retinopathy. METHODS: Over 4 years or longer, 178 normotensive women with type 1 diabetes (86 randomised to candesartan, 32 mg once daily, and 92 assigned to placebo) became pregnant (total of 208 pregnancies). RESULTS: More than half of patients were exposed to candesartan or placebo prior to or in early pregnancy, but all discontinued it at an estimated 8 weeks from the last menstrual period. Full-term pregnancies (51 vs 50), premature deliveries (21 vs 27), spontaneous miscarriages (12 vs 15), elective terminations (15 vs 14) and other outcomes (1 vs 2) were similar in the candesartan and placebo groups.

CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The risk for fetal consequences of ARBs in type 1 diabetes may not be high if exposure is clearly limited to the first trimester. Long-term studies in fertile women can be conducted with ARBs during pregnancy, provided investigators diligently stop their administration upon planning or detection of pregnancy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov DIRECT-Prevent 1 NCT00252733; DIRECT-Protect 1 NCT00252720; DIRECT-Protect 2 NCT00252694. FUNDING: The study was funded jointly by AstraZeneca and Takeda.},

	abstract = {Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are some of the most frequently prescribed antihypertensives in the United States. These agents are contraindicated during the second half of pregnancy because prior studies have demonstrated that use of ACE inhibitors late in pregnancy can cause oligohydramnios, fetal growth restriction, skull defects, infant anuria and renal failure, and death. Interestingly, little was known about the effects of ACE inhibitors when taken early during pregnancy. The purpose of the ACE Inhibitors in Early Pregnancy study was to clarify the safety of the use of ACE inhibitors during pregnancy by conducting an epidemiologic study using a large Medicaid database in which medications prescribed for pregnant women as a part of routine care and infant outcomes were studied. In the study, among 209 infants with first trimester exposure to ACE inhibitors, 7.1\% had any major congenital malformation. Compared with 29,096 infants with no exposure to any antihypertensive medication, among whom 2.6\% had any major congenital malformation, the adjusted risk of major congenital malformations was increased more than 2-fold. The risks of any congenital malformations and risks of specific organ system malformations, including cardiac malformations, were not increased in 202 infants with first trimester exposure to other antihypertensives when compared with infants with no antihypertensive exposure. Although this was an exploratory study whose findings should be confirmed, there are some important clinical insights that can be drawn from the study's conclusions. Further information on the pregnancy risks of ACE inhibitors and almost every other medication potentially used by pregnant women is needed. Thus, well-controlled studies to identify these risks should be undertaken. Until such information is available, alternative medications to ACE inhibitors should be considered in women of child-bearing age who are pregnant or who are likely to become pregnant while taking the medication.},

	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD009273.pub2},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are significant contributors to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. These disorders include well-controlled chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension (pregnancy-induced hypertension) and mild pre-eclampsia. The definitive treatment for these disorders is planned early delivery and the alternative is to manage the pregnancy expectantly if severe uncontrolled hypertension is not present, with close maternal and fetal monitoring. There are benefits and risks associated with both, so it is important to establish the safest option. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and risks of a policy of planned early delivery versus a policy of expectant management in pregnant women with hypertensive disorders, at or near term (from 34 weeks onwards). SEARCH METHODS: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Trials Register (12 January 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials of a policy of planned early delivery (by induction of labour or by caesarean section) compared with a policy of delayed delivery ("expectant management") for women with hypertensive disorders from 34 weeks' gestation. Cluster-randomised trials would have been eligible for inclusion in this review, but we found none.Studies using a quasi-randomised design are not eligible for inclusion in this review. Similarly, studies using a cross-over design are not eligible for inclusion, because they are not a suitable study design for investigating hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and risks of bias. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. MAIN RESULTS: We included five studies (involving 1819 women) in this review.There was a lower risk of composite maternal mortality and severe morbidity for women randomised to receive planned early delivery (risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.83, two studies, 1459 women (evidence graded high)). There were no clear differences between subgroups based on our subgroup analysis by gestational age, gestational week or condition. Planned early delivery was associated with lower risk of HELLP syndrome (RR 0.40, 95\% CI 0.17 to 0.93, 1628 women; three studies) and severe renal impairment (RR 0.36, 95\% CI 0.14 to 0.92, 100 women, one study).There was not enough information to draw any conclusions about the effects on composite infant mortality and severe morbidity. We observed a high level of heterogeneity between the two studies in this analysis (two studies, 1459 infants, I(2) = 87\%, Tau(2) = 0.98), so we did not pool data in meta-analysis. There were no clear differences between subgroups based on our subgroup analysis by gestational age, gestational week or condition. Planned early delivery was associated with higher levels of respiratory distress syndrome (RR 2.24, 95\% CI 1.20 to 4.18, three studies, 1511 infants), and NICU admission (RR 1.65, 95\% CI 1.13 to 2.40, four studies, 1585 infants).There was no clear difference between groups for caesarean section (RR 0.91, 95\% CI 0.78 to 1.07, 1728 women, four studies, evidence graded moderate), or in the duration of hospital stay for the mother after delivery of the baby (mean difference (MD) -0.16 days, 95\% CI -0.46 to 0.15, two studies, 925 women, evidence graded moderate) or for the baby (MD -0.20 days, 95\% CI -0.57 to 0.17, one study, 756 infants, evidence graded moderate).Two fairly large, well-designed trials with overall low risk of bias contributed the majority of the evidence. Other studies were at low or unclear risk of bias. No studies attempted to blind participants or clinicians to group allocation, potentially introducing bias as women and staff would have been aware of the intervention and this may have affected aspects of care and decision-making.The level of evidence was graded high (composite maternal mortality and morbidity), moderate (caesarean section, duration of hospital stay after delivery for mother, and duration of hospital stay after delivery for baby) or low (composite infant mortality and morbidity). Where the evidence was downgraded, it was mostly because the confidence intervals were wide, crossing both the line of no effect and appreciable benefit or harm. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: For women suffering from hypertensive disorders of pregnancy after 34 weeks, planned early delivery is associated with less composite maternal morbidity and mortality. There is no clear difference in the composite outcome of infant mortality and severe morbidity; however, this is based on limited data (from two trials) assessing all hypertensive disorders as one group.Further studies are needed to look at the different types of hypertensive diseases and the optimal timing of delivery for these conditions. These studies should also include infant and maternal morbidity and mortality outcomes, caesarean section, duration of hospital stay after delivery for mother and duration of hospital stay after delivery for baby.An individual patient meta-analysis on the data currently available would provide further information on the outcomes of the different types of hypertensive disease encountered in pregnancy.},

	doi = {10.1093/humupd/dmy037},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Worldwide, placenta-related complications contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction and preterm birth, with implications for the future health of mothers and offspring. The placenta develops in the periconception period and forms the interface between mother and embryo/fetus. An unhealthy periconceptional maternal lifestyle, such as smoking, alcohol and under- and over-nutrition, can detrimentally influence placental development and function. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: The impact of maternal lifestyle on placental health is largely unknown. Therefore, we aim to summarize the evidence of the impact of periconceptional maternal lifestyle on clinical features and biomarkers of placental development and function throughout pregnancy. SEARCH METHODS: A comprehensive search in Medline, Embase, Pubmed, The Cochrane Library Web of Science and Google Scholar was conducted. The search strategy included keywords related to the maternal lifestyle, smoking, alcohol, caffeine, nutrition (including folic acid supplement intake) and body weight. For placental markers throughout pregnancy, keywords related to ultrasound imaging, serum biomarkers and histological characteristics were used. We included randomized controlled trials and observational studies published between January 2000 and March 2017 and restricted the analysis to singleton pregnancies and maternal periconceptional lifestyle. Methodological quality was scored using the ErasmusAGE tool. A protocol of this systematic review has been registered in PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO 2016:CRD42016045596). OUTCOMES: Of 2593 unique citations found, 82 studies were included. The median quality score was 5 (range: 0-10). The findings revealed that maternal smoking was associated with lower first-trimester placental vascularization flow indices, higher second- and third-trimester resistance of the uterine and umbilical arteries and lower resistance of the middle cerebral artery. Although a negative impact of smoking on placental weight was expected, this was less clear. Alcohol use was associated with a lower placental weight. One study described higher second- and third-trimester placental growth factor (PlGF) levels after periconceptional alcohol use. None of the studies looked at caffeine intake. Adequate nutrition in the first trimester, periconceptional folic acid supplement intake and strong adherence to a Mediterranean diet, were all associated with a lower resistance of the uterine and umbilical arteries in the second and third trimester. A low caloric intake resulted in a lower placental weight, length, breadth, thickness, area and volume. Higher maternal body weight was associated with a larger placenta measured by ultrasound in the second and third trimester of pregnancy or weighed at birth. In addition, higher maternal body weight was associated with decreased PlGF-levels. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Evidence of the impact of periconceptional maternal lifestyle on placental health was demonstrated. However, due to poorly defined lifestyle exposures and time windows of investigation, unstandardized measurements of placenta-related outcomes and small sample sizes of the included studies, a cautious interpretation of the effect estimates is indicated. We suggest that future research should focus more on physiological consequences of unhealthy lifestyle during the critical periconception window. Moreover, we foresee that new evidence will support the development of lifestyle interventions to improve the health of mothers and their offspring from the earliest moment in life.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Several antihypertensive drugs are used in the treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy. The present study is a network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of these drugs. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for randomized clinical trials comparing drugs used in the treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy. The number of women achieving the target blood pressure (BP) was the primary outcome. Doses required and time taken for achieving the target BP, failure rate, and incidences of maternal tachycardia, palpitation, hypotension, headache, and neonatal death and stillbirth were the secondary outcomes. Mixed treatment comparison pooled estimates were generated using a random-effects model. Odds ratios for the categorical and mean difference for the numerical outcomes were the effect estimates. RESULTS: Fifty-one studies were included in the systematic review and 46 in the meta-analysis. No significant differences in the number of patients achieving target BP was observed between any of the drugs. Diazoxide [-15 (-20.6, -9.4)], nicardipine [-11.8 (-22.3, -1.2)], nifedipine/celastrol [-19.3 (-27.4, -11.1)], nifedipine/vitamin D [-17.1 (-25.7, -9.7)], nifedipine/resveratrol [-13.9 (-22.6, -5.2)] and glyceryl trinitrate [-33.8 (-36.7, -31)] were observed to achieve the target BP (in minutes) more rapidly than hydralazine. Nifedipine required fewer doses than hydralazine for achieving the target BP. Glyceryl trinitrate and labetalol were associated with fewer incidences of tachycardia and palpitation respectively than hydralazine. Trial sequential analysis concluded adequate evidence for hydralazine and nifedipine compared with labetalol. Moderate quality of evidence was observed for direct comparison estimate between labetalol and hydralazine but was either low or very low for other comparisons. CONCLUSION: The present evidence suggests similar efficacy between nifedipine, hydralazine and labetalol in the treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy. Subtle differences may exist in their safety profile. The evidence is inadequate for other drugs.},

This review discusses the management of pregnant patients with preexisting resistant hypertension and also of those who develop severe hypertension in gestation and puerperium. RECENT FINDINGS: The main cause of severe hypertension in pregnancy is preeclampsia, and differential diagnosis must be done with secondary or primary hypertension. Women with preexisting resistant hypertension may need pharmacological therapy adjustment. Several drugs can be used to treat severe hypertension, with exception of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. The most used drugs are methyldopa, beta-blockers, and calcium channel antagonists. There is a general agreement that severe hypertension must be treated, but there are still debates over the goals of the treatment. Delivery is indicated in viable pregnancies in which blood pressure control is not achieved with three drugs in full doses. Resistant hypertension may arise in postpartum. The management of resistant hypertension in pregnancy must regard the possible etiology, the fetal well-being, and the mother's risk. Good care is mandatory to reduce maternal mortality risk.},

In this review, we begin by demonstrating the roles that angiogenic factors play in pathogenesis of preeclampsia and its complications in the mother and the fetus. We then continue to report on the use of angiogenic markers as biomarkers to predict and risk-stratify disease. Strategies to treat preeclampsia by correcting the angiogenic balance, either by promoting proangiogenic factors or by removing antiangiogenic factors in both animal and human studies, are discussed.

Women with chronic hypertension are at significant risk for maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, yet it remains unclear whether antihypertensive treatment during pregnancy lowers these risks. Severe hypertension (systolic {\textgreater}/= 160 mm Hg) should be treated, but there is considerable variability in the approach to mild-to-moderate hypertension (140-159/90-109 mm Hg). The recently published CHIPS (Control of Hypertension in Pregnancy Study) trial is an important effort to attempt to determine treatment goals in mild to moderate pregnancy hypertension. The risks and benefits of tight versus less tight control of blood pressure in nonproteinuric hypertensive women, most of whom had pre-existing hypertension, were evaluated. A main finding was an increased risk of severe hypertension (adjusted odds ratio, 1.8) when blood pressure was not tightly controlled. In this review, general management of chronic hypertension in pregnancy is discussed, including changes in treatment that may be appropriate in light of new clinical trial data.},

Therefore it is essential that the medications used to treat these disorders be well understood. Furthermore the management is complicated by special consideration needed for the physiologic changes of pregnancy as well as the consideration for possible adverse fetal effects. Areas covered: We performed a review of the scientific literature of medications used to treat hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. We reviewed the guidelines used by different societies all over the world. We also discussed the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and possible adverse effects relating to the antihypertensive medications. Finally, we discussed the long-term maternal implications of these diseases. Expert opinion: Overall, we encourage a step-wise approach to treating hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. While making sure to max out the use of one medications prior to shifting to another. Also, it is imperative not to be aggressive with treatment due to risk of compromising utero-placental blood flow. There is research currently involving biomarkers, nano-medicine and the placenta project with hopes of developing new targeted medications with a good fetal safety profile.},

Inadequate prenatal care partially explains the persistent high prevalence in the developing world. In this review, we begin by presenting the most recent concepts in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Upstream triggers of the well described angiogenic pathways, such as the heme oxygenase and hydrogen sulfide pathways, as well as the roles of autoantibodies, misfolded proteins, nitric oxide, and oxidative stress will be described. We also detail updated definitions, classification schema, and treatment targets of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy put forth by obstetric and hypertensive societies throughout the world. The shift has been made to view preeclampsia as a systemic disease with widespread endothelial damage and the potential to affect future cardiovascular diseases rather than a self-limited occurrence. At the very least, we now know that preeclampsia does not end with delivery of the placenta. We conclude by summarizing the latest strategies for prevention and treatment of preeclampsia.

STUDY DESIGN: Observational cohort study of prospectively ascertained pregnancies from the German Embryotox pharmacovigilance institute. Pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to ACEIs during the first trimester were compared with pregnancies without antihypertensive treatment. In a sensitivity analysis, ACEI exposed hypertensive women were compared with hypertensive women on methyldopa. RESULTS: The risk of spontaneous abortion among 329 ACEI exposed women was not increased compared to 654 women without antihypertensive treatment (adjusted hazard ratio 1.20, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-1.92), whereas the risk for major birth defects (14/255; 5.5\% vs. 19/567; 3.4\%) was significantly increased (adjusted odds ratio 2.41, 95\% CI 1.07-5.43). In contrast, birth defect rates were not significantly different between hypertensive women on ACEIs and hypertensive women on methyldopa. In addition, we did not observe a distinct pattern of birth defects among retrospectively ascertained pregnancies after ACEI exposure during the first trimester. CONCLUSIONS: Women with hypertension treated with ACEIs in early pregnancy are at higher risk for major birth defects, which may be explained by other factors associated with maternal hypertension. Women (inadvertently) exposed during early pregnancy may be reassured and treatment switched to antihypertensive drugs recommended for pregnancy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Conventional cohort studies have consistently shown that exposure to maternal smoking in pregnancy is associated with about twice the risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the offspring. However, recent studies using alternative designs to disentangle the effect of social and genetic confounders have suggested that confounding may account for the association. In this study we aimed to estimate the association by a sibling design. METHODS: We used a design with half and full siblings in a Danish national register-based cohort on all singletons born between January 1991 and December 2006 and followed until January 2011. Data were available for 90\% (N = 968,665) of the singleton live births in the period. We used the combination of the International Classification of Diseases (10th version) diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder (HKD) and ADHD medication to identify children. We used sibling-matched (conditional) Cox regression to control social and genetic confounding. RESULTS: Using conventional cohort analyses, we found the expected association between pregnancy smoking and offspring ADHD (adjusted HR 2.01, 95\% CI 1.94-2.07). In the sibling analysis, however, we did not detect such a strong association (adjusted HR 1.07, 95\% CI 0.94-1.22). There was no difference between results for half- and full sibling analyses. The link between pregnancy smoking and low birth weight remained robust in the sibling design (adjusted OR 1.68, 95\% CI 1.33-2.12). CONCLUSIONS: We found no support for prenatal smoking as a strong causal factor in ADHD. Our findings suggest that the strong association found in most previous epidemiological studies is likely to be due to a strong link between maternal smoking and maternal ADHD genetics or shared family environment. Pregnant women should still be encouraged to stop smoking because of other risks, but we have no reason to believe that this would reduce the risk of ADHD in the offspring.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pre-existing conditions are imperfectly recorded in health care databases. We assessed whether pre-existing neurologic conditions (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis [MS]) were differentially recorded in the presence of major obstetric outcomes (Caesarean delivery, preterm delivery, preeclampsia) in delivery records. We also evaluated the impact of differential recording on measures of frequency and association between the conditions and outcomes. METHODS: The 2011-2014 Truven Health MarketScan(R) Commercial Claims Dataset was used to identify pregnancies. We calculated the relative recording of epilepsy and MS at delivery hospitalization compared with a 270-day pre-delivery window both overall and by the presence of major obstetric outcomes. We estimated risk ratios for the association between epilepsy and MS with the outcomes for each ascertainment window. RESULTS: We identified 909 065 pregnancies in women continuously enrolled from 270-days before the delivery date. Of women with epilepsy identified in the pre-delivery window, 73\% had the condition coded at delivery. For MS, the proportion was 60\%. MS recording at delivery did not vary by obstetric outcomes, however, delivery-coded epilepsy was less likely confirmed in the pre-delivery window in the presence of preeclampsia. Generally, the period of ascertainment did not meaningfully impact risk ratios, however, the risk ratio for preeclampsia associated with epilepsy was 1.67 (95\% CI 1.47, 1.90) when epilepsy was ascertained at delivery and 1.26 (95\% CI 1.07, 1.48) when epilepsy was ascertained in the pre-delivery window (heterogeneity, P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: Ascertainment of epilepsy and MS in delivery hospitalization records underestimated prevalence. However, the window of recording generally did not impact risk ratio estimates of associations with obstetric outcomes.},

The "within-pair" estimates acquired through these comparisons are free from confounding from all factors that are shared by the siblings. This has made sibling comparisons popular in studying associations thought likely to suffer confounding from socioeconomic or genetic factors. Despite the wide application of these designs in epidemiology, they have received little scrutiny from a statistical or methodological standpoint. In this paper we show, analytically and through a series of simulations, that the standard interpretation of the models is subject to several limitations that are rarely acknowledged.Although within-pair estimates will not be confounded by factors shared by the siblings, such estimates are more severely biased by non-shared confounders than the unpaired estimate. If siblings are less similar with regard to confounders than to the exposure under study, the within-pair estimate will always be more biased than the ordinary unpaired estimate. Attenuation of associations due to random measurement error in exposure will also be higher in the within-pair estimate, leading within-pair associations to be weaker than corresponding unpaired associations, even in the absence of confounding. Implications for the interpretation of sibling comparison results are discussed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bias in studies of preventive medications can occur when healthier patients are more likely to initiate and adhere to therapy than less healthy patients. We sought evidence of this bias by examining associations between statin exposure and various outcomes that should not be causally affected by statin exposure, such as workplace and motor vehicle accidents. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of statin patients using data from British Columbia, Canada, a multiethnic society with a population of 4.3 million people. Study subjects were 141 086 patients who initiated statins for primary prevention. We examined the association between adherence and multiple outcomes such as accidents and screening procedures using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. The study population was 49\% female and had an average age of 61 years. The results from our multivariable-adjusted models showed that more adherent patients were less likely to have accidents than less adherent patients. This effect was greatest for motor vehicle accidents (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95\% confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.79) and workplace accidents (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95\% confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.81). More adherent patients had a greater likelihood of using screening services (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95\% confidence interval, 1.15 to 1.20) and a lower likelihood of developing other diseases likely to be unrelated to a biological affect of a statin (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95\% confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.89). CONCLUSIONS: Our study contributes compelling evidence that patients who adhere to statins are systematically more health seeking than comparable patients who do not remain adherent. Caution is warranted when interpreting analyses that attribute surprising protective effects to preventive medications.},

It is routinely argued that within-family associations are automatically controlled for all measured and unmeasured covariates that are shared (constant) within sets of siblings, such as early childhood environment and parental genetic makeup. However, an important lesson from modern causal inference theory is that not all types of covariate control are desirable. In particular, it has been argued that collider control always leads to bias, and that mediator control may or may not lead to bias, depending on the research question. In this article, we use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to distinguish between shared confounders, shared mediators and shared colliders, and we examine which of these shared covariates the sibling comparison design really controls for.},

We measured interaction between PGD and maternal smoking, by calculating excess prevalence and prevalence ratio due to interaction, relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), attributable proportion (AP), and the synergy index (S).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advanced paternal age has been associated with offspring morbidity and mortality, possibly due to de novo mutations and epigenetic changes in male germ cells. Epigenetic changes in the cord blood cells have been linked to asthma symptoms in offspring, but the role of paternal age has been less studied. METHODS: From the Danish National Birth Cohort, 48,785 children who completed the 7-year follow-up were included. Parental reports of physician-diagnosed asthma had been obtained by a posted or web-based questionnaire. Paternal age at delivery was obtained through linkage with maternal civil registration number in the Danish Civil Registration System and classified into four groups: {\textless}/=24, 25-34 (reference), 35-39, and {\textgreater}40 years. We calculated the prevalence proportion of asthma and prevalence ratios (PRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) using log-binomial regression, adjusting for paternal smoking, paternal asthma, and paternal socioeconomic status. RESULTS: At the 7-year follow-up, 5875 children (12\%) had physician-diagnosed asthma. The prevalence of asthma in 7-year old children was higher with paternal age of {\textless}/=24 (adjusted PR 1.40; 95\% CI: 1.26; 1.55) and lower with the paternal age of {\textgreater}/=35 years (adjusted PR 0.84; 95\% CI: 0.78; 0.89) compared to the reference group. CONCLUSIONS: Paternal age of {\textgreater}/=35 years was associated with a lower prevalence of asthma in childhood, and paternal age of {\textless}/=24 years with higher prevalence compared with paternal age of 25-34 years. The potential causes of higher asthma prevalence among offspring of young fathers warrant further investigation.},

In particular, several scenarios are characterized by a general risk factor that appears protective in particular subpopulations, for example, individuals suffering from a specific disease. However, the associations are not necessarily representing causal effects. Selection bias due to conditioning on a collider may often be involved, and causal graphs are widely used to highlight such biases. These graphs, however, are qualitative, and they do not provide information on the real life relevance of a spurious association. Quantitative estimates of such associations can be obtained from simple statistical models. In this study, we present several paradoxical associations that occur in epidemiology, and we explore these associations in a causal, frailty framework. By using frailty models, we are able to put numbers on spurious effects that often are neglected in epidemiology. We discuss several counter-intuitive findings that have been reported in real life analyses, and we present calculations that may expand the understanding of these associations. In particular, we derive novel expressions to explain the magnitude of bias in index-event studies.},

We generalized the trimming definitions by considering multinomial PSs, one for each treatment and proved these proposed definitions reduce to the original binary definitions when we only have two treatment groups. We then examined the performance of the proposed multinomial trimming methods in the three treatment-group setting in which subjects with extreme PSs more likely had unmeasured confounders. Inverse probability of treatment weights, matching weights, and overlap weights were used to control for measured confounders. All three methods reduced bias regardless of the weighting methods in most scenarios. Multinomial Sturmer and Walker trimming were more successful in bias reduction when the three treatment groups had very different sizes (10:10:80). Variance reduction, seen in all methods with inverse probability of treatment weights but not with matching weights or overlap weights, was more successful with multinomial Crump and Sturmer trimming.

Moreover, in some matched-pair cohort studies, observation time is prematurely terminated immediately after the follow-up of his/her matched member is completed by an event or censoring. Although the follow-up termination within matched pairs may or may not change the hazard ratio estimators, when and how the change occurs has not been clarified. We study the change in the estimates of the hazard ratio conditional on matched pairs and/or covariates by considering two types of matched-pair designs in cohort studies-sibling pair matching and propensity score matching-in which termination can be naturally considered. If all possible confounders are shared within the matched pairs, after termination, a wide range of hazard ratio estimators coincides with that obtained from a stratified Cox model. If unshared confounders should be adjusted for in the analysis, however, such coincidence is not observed. Simulation studies on sibling designs with unshared confounders suggested that the pair-stratified covariate-adjusted Cox model for the hazard ratio conditional on matched pairs and covariates is generally preferred, for which termination does not deteriorate the estimation. Conversely, the comparison between stratifying or not stratifying on pair is a more subtle issue in propensity score matching which targets a marginal or covariate-conditional hazard ratio. Based on simulation studies considering Cox models after matching based on estimated propensity scores, we discourage pair-stratified analysis and termination, particularly after data collection.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic disparities in infant mortality have persisted for decades in high-income countries and may have become stronger in some populations. Therefore, new understandings of the mechanisms that underlie socioeconomic differences in infant deaths are essential for creating and implementing health initiatives to reduce these deaths. We aimed to explore whether and the extent to which preterm birth (PTB) and small for gestational age (SGA) at birth mediate the association between maternal education and infant mortality. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a population-based cohort study to include all 1,994,618 live singletons born in Denmark in 1981-2015. Infants were followed from birth until death, emigration, or the day before the first birthday, whichever came first. Maternal education at childbirth was categorized as low, medium, or high. An inverse probability weighting of marginal structural models was used to estimate the controlled direct effect (CDE) of maternal education on offspring infant mortality, further split into neonatal (0-27 days) and postneonatal (28-364 days) deaths, and portion eliminated (PE) by eliminating mediation by PTB and SGA. The proportion eliminated by eliminating mediation by PTB and SGA was reported if the mortality rate ratios (MRRs) of CDE and PE were in the same direction. The MRRs between maternal education and infant mortality were 1.63 (95\% CI 1.48-1.80, P {\textless} 0.001) and 1.19 (95\% CI 1.08-1.31, P {\textless} 0.001) for low and medium versus high education, respectively. The estimated proportions of these total associations eliminated by reducing PTB and SGA together were 55\% (MRRPE = 1.27, 95\% CI 1.15-1.40, P {\textless} 0.001) for low and 60\% (MRRPE = 1.11, 95\% CI 1.01-1.22, P = 0.037) for medium versus high education. The proportions eliminated by eliminating PTB and SGA separately were, respectively, 46\% and 11\% for low education (versus high education) and 48\% and 13\% for medium education (versus high education). PTB and SGA together contributed more to the association of maternal educational disparities with neonatal mortality (proportion eliminated: 75\%-81\%) than with postneonatal mortality (proportion eliminated: 21\%-23\%). Limitations of the study include the untestable assumption of no unmeasured confounders for the causal mediation analysis, and the limited generalizability of the findings to other countries with varying disparities in access and quality of perinatal healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: PTB and SGA may play substantial roles in the relationship between low maternal education and infant mortality, especially for neonatal mortality. The mediating role of PTB appeared to be much stronger than that of SGA. Public health strategies aimed at reducing neonatal mortality in high-income countries may need to address socially related prenatal risk factors of PTB and impaired fetal growth. The substantial association of maternal education with postneonatal mortality not accounted for by PTB or SGA could reflect unaddressed educational disparities in infant care or other factors.},

Data from the Collaborative Perinatal Project, a multisite US study conducted from 1959 to 1974, are used to create a masked data-analytical challenge with missing data induced by known mechanisms. We illustrate the deleterious effects of missing data with naive methods and show how principled methods can sometimes mitigate such effects. For example, when data were missing at random, naive methods showed a spurious protective effect of smoking on the risk of spontaneous abortion (odds ratio (OR) = 0.43, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.19, 0.93), while implementation of principled methods multiple imputation (OR = 1.30, 95\% CI: 0.95, 1.77) or augmented inverse probability weighting (OR = 1.40, 95\% CI: 1.00, 1.97) provided estimates closer to the "true" full-data effect (OR = 1.31, 95\% CI: 1.05, 1.64).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Both threatened miscarriage and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are common complications of pregnancy. However, only one pilot study has reported that these complications are not related. We aimed to investigate whether threatened miscarriage is one of the risk factors of GDM. METHODS: An unmatched case-control study of 1567 pregnant Korean women who underwent a two-step approach to diagnose GDM was retrospectively conducted. The eligible women were classified into normal (n = 840), borderline GDM (n = 480), and GDM (n = 247) groups. We analyzed the associations with threatened miscarriage in all groups with adjustment for confounding factors. RESULTS: The proportion of women who experienced threatened miscarriage was significantly lower in the GDM group than in the normal group (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 0.38; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.18-0.78). It was significantly lower in the maternal hyperglycemia group (borderline GDM and GDM groups) than in the normal group (adjusted OR, 0.66; 95\% CI, 0.47-0.91). The proportion of women who experienced threatened miscarriage was also significantly lower in the GDM group than in the normal (adjusted OR, 0.35; 95\% CI, 0.17-0.70) and borderline GDM groups (adjusted OR, 0.46; 95\% CI, 0.22-0.94). Moreover, the proportion of women who experienced threatened miscarriage significantly decreased according to the severity of glucose intolerance (adjusted OR, 0.94; 95\% CI, 0.76-1.16). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that threatened miscarriage is associated with decreased risk of GDM and the severity of glucose intolerance in Korean women. Additional studies are warranted to understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms that might exist between these frequent complications of pregnancy.},

METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCT) were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. Trials were included if they compared progesterone with placebo, no treatment or any other treatment given in an effort to treat threatened miscarriage. Pregnant prophylaxis drugs were not included without strict progesterone type, language and progesterone management. The primary outcome was the incidence of miscarriage.

Dydrogesterone was shown to have a lower risk of miscarriage (RR = 0.49, 95\% CI 0.33-0.75) than natural progesterone (RR = 0.69, 95\% CI 0.40-1.19). Oral management was demonstrated to have a lower risk of miscarriage (RR = 0.55, 95\% CI 0.38-0.79) compared with vaginal administration (RR = 0.58, 95\% CI 0.28-1.21). CONCLUSION: Our findings show that progesterone agents are effective in reducing the incidence of miscarriage in threatened miscarriage. Dydrogesterone, but not natural progesterone, was associated with a lower risk of miscarriage. Given the limitations of the studies included in our meta-analysis, it is difficult to recommend route and dose of progesterone therapy. Further head-to-head trials of gestational weeks and long-time follow-up are required.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Miscarriage is a common complication encountered during pregnancy. It is defined as spontaneous pregnancy loss before 20 weeks' gestation. Progesterone's physiological role is to prepare the uterus for the implantation of the embryo, enhance uterine quiescence and suppress uterine contractions, hence, it may play a role in preventing rejection of the embryo. Inadequate secretion of progesterone in early pregnancy has been linked to the aetiology of miscarriage and progesterone supplementation has been used as a treatment for threatened miscarriage to prevent spontaneous pregnancy loss. This update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2007, and previously updated in 2011, investigates the evidence base for this practice. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and the safety of progestogens in the treatment of threatened miscarriage. SEARCH METHODS: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (8 August 2017) and reference lists of retrieved trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, quasi-randomised or cluster-randomised controlled trials, that compared progestogen with placebo, no treatment or any other treatment for the treatment of threatened miscarriage in women carrying singleton pregnancy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors assessed the trials for inclusion in the review, assessed trial quality and extracted the data and graded the body of evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We included seven trials (involving 696 participants) in this update of the review. The included trials were conducted in different countries, covering the full spectrum of the World Bank's economic classification, which enhances the applicability of evidence drawn from this review. Two trials were conducted in Germany and Italy which are high-income countries, while four trials were conducted in upper-middle income countries; two in Iran, one in Malaysia and the fourth in Turkey, and the seventh trial was conducted in Jordan, which is a lower-middle income country. In six trials all the participants met the inclusion criteria and in the seventh study, we included in the meta-analysis only the subgroup of participants who met the inclusion criteria. We assessed the body of evidence for the main outcomes using the GRADE tool and the quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Downgrading of evidence was based on the high risk of bias in six of the seven included trials and a small number of events and wide confidence intervals for some outcomes.Treatment of miscarriage with progestogens compared to placebo or no treatment probably reduces the risk of miscarriage; (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 0.87; 7 trials; 696 women; moderate-quality evidence). Treatment with oral progestogen compared to no treatment also probably reduces the miscarriage rate (RR 0.57, 95\% CI 0.38 to 0.85; 3 trials; 408 women; moderate-quality evidence). However treatment with vaginal progesterone compared to placebo, probably has little or no effect in reducing the miscarriage rate (RR 0.75, 95\% CI 0.47 to 1.21; 4 trials; 288 women; moderate-quality evidence). The subgroup interaction test indicated no difference according to route of administration between the oral and vaginal subgroups of progesterone.Treatment of preterm birth with the use of progestogens compared to placebo or no treatment may have little or no effect in reducing the rate of preterm birth (RR 0.86, 95\% CI 0.52 to 1.44; 5 trials; 588 women; low-quality evidence).We are uncertain if treatment of threatened miscarriage with progestogens compared to placebo or no treatment has any effect on the rate of congenital abnormalities because the quality of the evidence is very low (RR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.10 to 4.82; 2 trials; 337 infants; very-low quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results of this Cochrane Review suggest that progestogens are probably effective in the treatment of threatened miscarriage but may have little or no effect in the rate of preterm birth. The evidence on congenital abnormalities is uncertain, because the quality of the evidence for this outcome was based on only two small trials with very few events and was found to be of very low quality.},

The primary objective of this study was to explore the services available (ED management, ultrasound access, and follow-up care) for ED patients experiencing early pregnancy loss or threatened early pregnancy loss in Ontario hospitals. METHODS: The emergency medicine chiefs of 71 Ontario hospital EDs with an annual census of more than 30,000 ED patient visits in 2017 were invited to complete a 30-item, online questionnaire using modified Dillman methodology. RESULTS: Respondents from 63 EDs across Ontario completed the survey (response rate 88.7\%). Of the EDs surveyed, 34 (54.0\%) reported that they did not have access to early pregnancy clinic services for women who presented to the ED with early pregnancy complications that were safe to discharge home. At these hospitals, it was found that patients were followed up in 14 (41.2\%) EDs for the same complications, including pregnancy of unknown location and threatened abortion. Respondents also stated that a radiologist-interpreted ultrasound was available to only 22 (34.9\%) of hospital sites for 24 hours, 7 days per week for women with early pregnancy complications. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study highlight the reliance of some hospitals on the ED to provide ongoing follow-up care to patients experiencing complications of early pregnancy. The lack of clinical resources and specialized personnel in Ontario hospital EDs makes supporting these women longitudinally unrealistic, exposing them to undue risk and complications.},

A computerized search was performed in Medline, Embase, and Ovid Medline for original reports with the product name 'Duphaston' or 'dydrogesterone', and limited to clinical human data. Twenty-one reports of dydrogesterone treatment were identified with 1380 patients. Five randomized trials were identified, including 660 women who fulfilled the criteria for meta-analysis. The number of subsequent miscarriages or continuing pregnancies per randomized woman was compared in women receiving dydrogesterone compared to standard bed rest or placebo intervention. There was a 13\% (44/335) miscarriage rate after dydrogesterone administration compared to 24\% in control women [odds ratio for miscarriage 0.47, (CI = 0.31-0.7), 11\% absolute reduction in the miscarriage rate]. The adverse and side effects were summarized in all 21 reports, and seemed to be minimal. Although all the predictive and confounding factors could not be controlled for, the results of this systematic review show a significant reduction of 47\% in the odds for miscarriage when dydrogesterone is compared to standard care indicating a real treatment effect.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Selection bias is a form of systematic error that can be severe in compromised study designs such as case-control studies with inappropriate selection mechanisms or follow-up studies that suffer from extensive attrition. External adjustment for selection bias is commonly undertaken when such bias is suspected, but the methods used can be overly simplistic, if not unrealistic, and fail to allow for simultaneous adjustment of associations of the exposure and covariates with the outcome, when of interest. Internal adjustment for selection bias via inverse probability weighting allows bias parameters to vary with the levels of covariates but has only been formalized for longitudinal studies with covariate data on patients up until loss to follow-up. METHODS: We demonstrate the use of inverse probability weighting and externally obtained bias parameters to perform internal adjustment of selection bias in studies lacking covariate data on unobserved participants. RESULTS: The "true" or selection-adjusted odds ratio for the association between exposure and outcome was successfully obtained by analyzing only data on those in the selected stratum (i.e., responders) weighted by the inverse probability of their being selected as function of their observed covariate data. CONCLUSIONS: This internal adjustment technique using user-supplied bias parameters and inverse probability weighting for selection bias can be applied to any type of observational study.},

The Danish medical databases include administrative, health, and clinical quality databases.

This review describes key elements of the Danish health care system from planning and delivery to record generation. First, it presents the history of the health care system, its overall organization and financing. Second, it details delivery of primary, hospital, psychiatric, and elderly care. Third, the path from a health care contact to a database record is followed. Finally, an overview of the available data sources is presented. This review discusses the data quality of each type of medical database and describes the relative technical ease and cost-effectiveness of exact individual-level linkage among them. It is shown, from an epidemiological point of view, how Denmark's population represents an open dynamic cohort with complete long-term follow-up, censored only at emigration or death. It is concluded that Denmark's constellation of universal health care, long-standing routine registration of most health and life events, and the possibility of exact individual-level data linkage provides unlimited possibilities for epidemiological research.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To estimate the burden of miscarriage in the Norwegian population and to evaluate the associations with maternal age and pregnancy history. DESIGN: Prospective register based study. SETTING: Medical Birth Register of Norway, the Norwegian Patient Register, and the induced abortion register. PARTICIPANTS: All Norwegian women that were pregnant between 2009-13. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Risk of miscarriage according to the woman's age and pregnancy history estimated by logistic regression. RESULTS: There were 421 201 pregnancies during the study period. The risk of miscarriage was lowest in women aged 25-29 (10\%), and rose rapidly after age 30, reaching 53\% in women aged 45 and over. There was a strong recurrence risk of miscarriage, with age adjusted odds ratios of 1.54 (95\% confidence interval 1.48 to 1.60) after one miscarriage, 2.21 (2.03 to 2.41) after two, and 3.97 (3.29 to 4.78) after three consecutive miscarriages. The risk of miscarriage was modestly increased if the previous birth ended in a preterm delivery (adjusted odds ratio 1.22, 95\% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.29), stillbirth (1.30, 1.11 to 1.53), caesarean section (1.16, 1.12 to 1.21), or if the woman had gestational diabetes in the previous pregnancy (1.19, 1.05 to 1.36). The risk of miscarriage was slightly higher in women who themselves had been small for gestational age (1.08, 1.04 to 1.13). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of miscarriage varies greatly with maternal age, shows a strong pattern of recurrence, and is also increased after some adverse pregnancy outcomes. Miscarriage and other pregnancy complications might share underlying causes, which could be biological conditions or unmeasured common risk factors.},

If the measured confounders are sufficient for confounding control, then the marginal association measures can be interpreted as poulation causal effects.

In this paper, we develop adjusted RD and NNT measures for use in observational studies with survival time outcomes within the framework of the Cox proportional hazards regression model taking the distribution of confounders into account. We consider the typical situation of a cohort study in which the effect of an exposure on a survival time outcome is investigated and important covariates have to be taken into account. The exposure effect described by means of the RD and NNT measures in dependence on whether the effect of allocating an exposure to unexposed persons (number needed to be exposed) or that of removing an exposure from exposed persons (exposure impact number) is considered. Estimation of these adjusted RD and NNT measures is performed by using the average RD approach recently developed for logistic regression. To determine standard errors and confidence intervals for these estimators we use two approaches, the delta method with respect to the regression coefficients of the Cox model and bootstrapping and compare each other. The performance of these estimators is assessed by performing Monte Carlo simulations demonstrating clear advantages of the bootstrap method. The proposed method for point and interval estimation of adjusted RD and NNT measures in the Cox model is illustrated by means of data of the Dusseldorf Obesity Mortality Study (DOMS).},

This study examined whether OCD is associated with an increased risk of metabolic and cardiovascular complications. METHODS: Individuals diagnosed with OCD (n = 25,415) were identified from a cohort of 12,497,002 individuals living in Sweden between 1973 and 2013. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to investigate the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular complications in OCD patients compared with the general population and unaffected full siblings of OCD individuals. Exploratory analyses were used to examine the effect of treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors, with or without antipsychotics, on the outcomes of interest. RESULTS: Individuals with OCD had a higher risk of any metabolic or cardiovascular complications compared with the general population (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.45; 95\% confidence interval = 1.42-1.49) and their unaffected full siblings (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.47; 95\% confidence interval = 1.40-1.54). In the fully adjusted sibling comparison models, patients had higher risks of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and circulatory system diseases. The risks were already evident from the beginning of the follow-up period and remained largely unchanged when excluding different groups of psychiatric comorbidities. Compared with patients who were not taking serotonin reuptake inhibitors, patients taking higher doses of serotonin reuptake inhibitors and who had a longer duration of treatment had significantly lower risks of metabolic and cardiovascular complications, regardless of whether they were also taking antipsychotics. CONCLUSIONS: OCD is associated with an increased risk of metabolic and cardiovascular complications. Our results underscore the importance of carefully monitoring metabolic and cardiovascular health in patients with OCD early in the course of the disorder.},

We investigated whether surrogate markers for potential adverse microbiota change in infancy affected autism risk, addressing unobserved confounding using a sibling study design. METHODS: This is a population-based, prospective cohort study including all singleton live births in Denmark from 1997 to 2010. The exposure variables were cesarean delivery and antibiotic use in the first 2 years of life. The outcome was a subsequent autism diagnosis. We used the between- and within-sibling model and compared it with sibling-stratified Cox models and simpler standard Cox models that ignored sibship. RESULTS: Of our study population including 671,606 children, who were followed for up to 15 years (7,341,133 person-years), 72\% received antibiotics, 17.5\% were delivered by cesarean, and 1.2\% (8,267) developed autism. The standard Cox models predicted that both cesarean (compared with vaginal) delivery and antibiotics increased the risk of autism. In the sibling-stratified Cox model, only broader spectrum antibiotics were associated with increased risk of autism: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.16 (95\% confidence interval = 1.01, 1.36). The between-within model estimated no exposure effects: intrapartum cesarean HR = 1.06 (0.89, 1.26); prelabor cesarean HR = 0.97 (0.83, 1.15); exclusively penicillin HR = 1.05 (0.93, 1.18); and broader spectrum antibiotics HR = 1.05 (0.95, 1.16). CONCLUSIONS: The between-within model rendered more precise estimates than sibling-stratified Cox models, and we believe that it also provided more valid estimates. Results from these preferred models do not support a causal relation between antibiotic treatment during infancy, cesarean delivery, and autism.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty index (FI) is a well-established predictor of all-cause mortality, but less is known for cause-specific mortality and whether familial effects influence the associations. Middle-aged individuals are also understudied for the association between FI and mortality. Furthermore, the population mortality impact of frailty remains understudied. METHODS: We estimated the predictive value of FI for all-cause and cause-specific mortality, taking into account familial factors, and tested whether the associations are time-dependent. We also assessed the proportion of all-cause and cause-specific deaths that are attributable to increased levels of frailty. We analyzed 42,953 participants from the Screening Across the Lifespan Twin Study (aged 41-95 years at baseline) with up to 20 years' mortality follow-up. The FI was constructed using 44 health-related items. Deaths due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), respiratory-related causes, and cancer were considered in the cause-specific analysis. Generalized survival models were used in the analysis. RESULTS: Increased FI was associated with higher risks of all-cause, CVD, and respiratory-related mortality, with the corresponding hazard ratios of 1.28 (1.24, 1.32), 1.31 (1.23, 1.40), and 1.23 (1.11, 1.38) associated with a 10\% increase in FI in male single responders, and 1.21 (1.18, 1.25), 1.27 (1.15, 1.34), and 1.26 (1.15, 1.39) in female single responders. No significant associations were observed for cancer mortality. No attenuation of the mortality associations in unrelated individuals was observed when adjusting for familial effects in twin pairs. The associations were time-dependent with relatively greater effects observed in younger ages. Before the age of 80, the proportions of deaths attributable to FI levels {\textgreater} 0.21 were 18.4\% of all-cause deaths, 25.4\% of CVD deaths, and 20.4\% of respiratory-related deaths in men and 19.2\% of all-cause deaths, 27.8\% of CVD deaths, and 28.5\% of respiratory-related deaths in women. After the age of 80, the attributable proportions decreased, most notably for all-cause and CVD mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Increased FI predicts higher risks of all-cause, CVD, and respiratory-related mortality independent of familial effects. Increased FI presents a relatively greater risk factor at midlife than in old age. Increased FI has a significant population mortality impact that is greatest through midlife until the age of 80.},

	abstract = {A popular way to control for confounding in observational studies is to identify clusters of individuals (e.g., twin pairs), such that a large set of potential confounders are constant (shared) within each cluster. By studying the exposure-outcome association within clusters, we are in effect controlling for the whole set of shared confounders. An increasingly popular analysis tool is the between-within (BW) model, which decomposes the exposure-outcome association into a 'within-cluster effect' and a 'between-cluster effect'. BW models are relatively common for nonsurvival outcomes and have been studied in the theoretical literature. Although it is straightforward to use BW models for survival outcomes, this has rarely been carried out in practice, and such models have not been studied in the theoretical literature. In this paper, we propose a gamma BW model for survival outcomes. We compare the properties of this model with the more standard stratified Cox regression model and use the proposed model to analyze data from a twin study of obesity and mortality. We find the following: (i) the gamma BW model often produces a more powerful test of the 'within-cluster effect' than stratified Cox regression; and (ii) the gamma BW model is robust against model misspecification, although there are situations where it could give biased estimates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Therapeutic advances have improved survival after hematological cancers. In turn, patients may be at increased risk of thromboembolic and bleeding events. OBJECTIVES: To examine the risks of myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and bleeding requiring hospital contact in patients with hematological cancers. METHODS: We conducted a Danish population-based cohort study (2000-2013). We identified all adult hematological cancer patients and sampled a general population comparison cohort in a 1:5 ratio matched by age, sex, previous thromboembolic events, bleeding, and solid cancer. Ten-year absolute risks of thromboembolism and bleeding were calculated and hazard ratios (HRs) were computed, controlling for matching factors. RESULTS: Among 32 141 hematological cancer patients, the 10-year absolute risk of any thromboembolic or bleeding complication following hematological cancer was 19\%: 3.3\% for MI, 3.5\% for ischemic stroke, 5.2\% for VTE, and 8.5\% for bleeding. Except among patients with myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoid leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome, the risk of thromboembolic events surpassed that of bleeding. The hematological cancer cohort overall was at increased risk for MI [HR = 1.36, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.25-1.49], ischemic stroke (HR = 1.22, 95\% CI: 1.12-1.33), VTE (HR = 3.37, 95\% CI: 3.13-3.64), and bleeding (HR = 2.39, 95\% CI: 2.26-2.53) compared with the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 2 of 10 hematological cancer patients experienced MI, ischemic stroke, VTE, or bleeding requiring hospital contact within 10 years. The hematological cancer cohort had higher hazards of MI, ischemic stroke, VTE, and bleeding requiring hospital contact than a general population comparison cohort.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12884-016-1217-0},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In high-income countries, the incidence of severe postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) has increased. This has important public health relevance because severe PPH is a leading cause of major maternal morbidity. However, few studies have identified risk factors for severe PPH within a contemporary obstetric cohort. METHODS: We performed a case-control study to identify risk factors for severe PPH among a cohort of women who delivered at one of three hospitals in Norway between 2008 and 2011. A case (severe PPH) was classified by an estimated blood loss {\textgreater}/=1500 mL or the need for blood transfusion for excessive postpartum bleeding. Using logistic regression, we applied a pragmatic strategy to identify independent risk factors for severe PPH. RESULTS: Among a total of 43,105 deliveries occurring between 2008 and 2011, we identified 1064 cases and 2059 random controls. The frequency of severe PPH was 2.5\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.32-2.62). The most common etiologies for severe PPH were uterine atony (60\%) and placental complications (36\%). The strongest risk factors were a history of severe PPH (adjusted OR (aOR) = 8.97, 95\% CI: 5.25-15.33), anticoagulant medication (aOR = 4.79, 95\% CI: 2.72-8.41), anemia at booking (aOR = 4.27, 95\% CI: 2.79-6.54), severe pre-eclampsia or HELLP syndrome (aOR = 3.03, 95\% CI: 1.74-5.27), uterine fibromas (aOR = 2.71, 95\% CI: 1.69-4.35), multiple pregnancy (aOR = 2.11, 95\% CI: 1.39-3.22) and assisted reproductive technologies (aOR = 1.88, 95\% CI: 1.33-2.65). CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, women with a history of severe PPH are at highest risk of severe PPH. As well as other established clinical risk factors for PPH, a history of severe PPH should be included as a risk factor in the development and validation of prediction models for PPH.},

They call this technique "propensity score calibration" (PSC) and assess its strengths and limitations with simulated data. Their analyses demonstrate that PSC greatly improves inference when the critical assumption of surrogacy holds, but when surrogacy does not hold, PSC estimation can exacerbate bias relative to uncorrected propensity score models. The benefits of propensity score methods (and PSC) lie not only with potentially improved effect estimation but with conceptualization and practice as well.},

The authors recently introduced propensity score calibration (PSC), which combines propensity scores and regression calibration to address confounding by variables unobserved in the main study by using variables observed in a validation study. Here, the authors assess the performance of PSC using simulations in settings with and without violation of the key assumption of PSC: that the error-prone propensity score estimated in the main study is a surrogate for the gold-standard propensity score (i.e., it contains no additional information on the outcome). The assumption can be assessed if data on the outcome are available in the validation study. If data are simulated allowing for surrogacy to be violated, results depend largely on the extent of violation. If surrogacy holds, PSC leads to bias reduction between 32\% and 106\% ({\textgreater}100\% representing overcorrection). If surrogacy is violated, PSC can lead to an increase in bias. Surrogacy is violated when the direction of confounding of the exposure-disease association caused by the unobserved variable(s) differs from that of the confounding due to observed variables. When surrogacy holds, PSC is a useful approach to adjust for unmeasured confounding using validation data.},

METHODS: We investigated this association in a matched case-control study including incident cancer cases during 2002-2009 in the Danish Cancer Registry (n = 94 923) and age- and sex-matched (1:8) population controls (n = 759 334). Long-term benzodiazepine use was defined as {\textgreater}/=500 defined daily doses 1-5 years prior to the index date. We implemented propensity score (PS) calibration using external information on confounders available from a survey of the Danish population. Two PSs were used: The error-prone PS using register-based confounders and the calibrated PS based on both register- and survey-based confounders, retrieved from the Health Interview Survey. RESULTS: Register-based data showed that cancer cases had more diagnoses, higher comorbidity score and more co-medication then population controls. Survey-based data showed lower self-rated health, more self-reported diseases, and more smokers as well as subjects with sedentary lifestyle among benzodiazepine users. By PS calibration, the odds ratio for cancer overall associated with benzodiazepine use decreased from 1.16 to 1.09 (95\% confidence interval 1.00-1.19) and for smoking-related cancers from 1.20 to 1.10 (95\% confidence interval 1.00-1.21). CONCLUSION: We conclude that the increased risk observed in the solely register-based study could partly be attributed to unmeasured confounding.},

We aimed to quantitatively assess the relationship by summarizing all relevant epidemiological studies.

Ten prospective studies, 35 case-control studies and 1 pooled analysis of 10 cohort and 14 case-control studies including 69681 patients were identified. Pooled analysis revealed that there was a significant inverse association between parity and risk of endometrial cancer (relative risk (RR) for parous versus nulliparous: 0.69, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.65-0.74; I(2) = 76.9\%).

The dose-response analysis suggested a nonlinear relationship between the number of parity and endometrial cancer risk. The RR decreased when the number of parity increased.

Analysis of maternal near miss could increase understanding of survival among women with life-threatening PPH. OBJECTIVES: To determine the near-miss ratio and maternal mortality index for PPH globally. SEARCH STRATEGY: A prevalence systematic review was conducted of English-language articles published from 1995 to 2014. Suitable articles were identified from the Scopus, PubMed, Embase, and Grey Literature databases. The main search terms used were "maternal near-miss" and "severe acute maternal morbidity." SELECTION CRITERIA: Near-miss studies and audits describing the severe maternal outcome rate for PPH were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted from eligible publications. Quantitative analysis and narrative synthesis were used. MAIN RESULTS: For 26 included studies, the median near-miss ratio for PPH was 3 per 1000 live births. The mortality index for PPH was 6.6\% (range 0.0\%-40.7\%). The mortality index was highest in low-income countries and lower middle-income countries. Overall, PPH was the most frequent contributor to obstetric hemorrhage, with atonic uterus identified as the main cause. CONCLUSIONS: Women in low-income countries and lower middle-income countries have an increased likelihood of severe PPH and of dying from PPH-related consequences.},

After reviewing the conceptual and computational features of these methods, a new implementation of hurdle and zero-inflated regression models in the functions hurdle () and zeroinfl () from the package pscl is introduced. It re-uses design and functionality of the basic R functions just as the underlying conceptual tools extend the classical models. Both hurdle and zero-in inflated model, are able to incorporate over-dispersion and excess zeros-two problems that typically occur in count data sets in economics and the social sciences-better than their classical counterparts.

	abstract = {Background stratified Poisson regression is an approach that has been used in the analysis of data derived from a variety of epidemiologically important studies of radiation-exposed populations, including uranium miners, nuclear industry workers, and atomic bomb survivors. We describe a novel approach to fit Poisson regression models that adjust for a set of covariates through background stratification while directly estimating the radiation-disease association of primary interest. The approach makes use of an expression for the Poisson likelihood that treats the coefficients for stratum-specific indicator variables as 'nuisance' variables and avoids the need to explicitly estimate the coefficients for these stratum-specific parameters. Log-linear models, as well as other general relative rate models, are accommodated. This approach is illustrated using data from the Life Span Study of Japanese atomic bomb survivors and data from a study of underground uranium miners. The point estimate and confidence interval obtained from this 'conditional' regression approach are identical to the values obtained using unconditional Poisson regression with model terms for each background stratum. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed approach allows estimation of background stratified Poisson regression models of non-standard form, such as models that parameterize latency effects, as well as regression models in which the number of strata is large, thereby overcoming the limitations of previously available statistical software for fitting background stratified Poisson regression models.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often occur together in the same individual. However, it remains unknown whether siblings of children with ASD have an increased risk of epilepsy and vice versa. This study determines the risk of ASD and epilepsy among younger siblings of children with ASD and epilepsy. DESIGN: The study included all children born in Denmark between January 1, 1980 and 31 December 2006 who participated in follow-up until December 31, 2012 (1,663,302 children). We used Cox regression to calculate the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and the Kaplan-Meier method to calculate the cumulative incidence. RESULTS: The overall aHR of epilepsy in younger siblings increased by 70\% (aHR 1.70, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-2.16\%) if the older sibling had ASD compared with siblings where the older sibling did not have ASD. The cumulative incidence of epilepsy at 20 years of age was 2.54\% (95\% CI 1.97-3.26\%) if the older sibling had ASD, whereas the cumulative incidence of epilepsy at 20 years of age was 1.63\% (95\% CI 1.60-1.66\%) if the older sibling did not have ASD. The overall aHR of ASD in younger siblings increased by 54\% if the older sibling had epilepsy (aHR 1.54, 95\% CI 1.32-1.80) compared with siblings where the older sibling did not have epilepsy. The cumulative incidence of ASD at 20 years of age was 2.06\% (95\% CI 1.84-2.32\%) if the older sibling had epilepsy, whereas the cumulative incidence of ASD at 20 years of age was 1.27\% (95\% CI 1.25-1.29\%) if the older sibling did not have epilepsy. SIGNIFICANCE: The cross-disorder sibling risk of epilepsy and ASD was increased for the two disorders, which suggests that genes or environmental factors shared by family members may play a causal role in the co-occurrence of ASD and epilepsy.},

Design Comparison of population based data.

Main outcome measures Epilepsy, psychosis, personal birth data.
Results We found an increased risk of schizophrenia (relative risk 2.48, 95\% confidence interval 2.20 to 2.80) and schizophrenia-like psychosis (2.93, 2.69 to 3.20) in people with a history of epilepsy. The effect of epilepsy was the same in men and in women and increased with age. Family history of psychosis and a family history of epilepsy were significant risk factors for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychosis, and the effect of epilepsy, both in cases and families, was greater among people with no family history of psychosis. In addition, the increased risk for schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis did not differ by type of epilepsy but increased with increasing number of admissions to hospital and, particularly, was significantly greater for people first admitted for epilepsy at later ages.
Conclusions There is a strong association between epilepsy and schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis. The two conditions may share common genetic or environmental causes.},

We used Cox’s regression analysis to compute hazard ratios comparing children with and without IRDS, adjusting for sex, birth year, gestational age, multiplicity, major malformations, and maternal age. We identified 95,026 infants, of whom 6426 (6.8\%) had IRDS. The cumulative incidence of epilepsy was 3.4\% by age 15 in children with IRDS and 2.1\% in children without IRDS. The adjusted hazard ratio of epilepsy among children with IRDS compared to those without was 1.4 (95\% CI 1.2–1.6). When we restricted the IRDS cohort to children with no simultaneous morbidities that had clinical symptoms overlapping with IRDS, the overall adjusted HR was 1.1 (95\% CI 0.9–1.4).

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Many data on the course and prognosis after provoked and unprovoked single and multiple seizures in childhood have been collected in the past decennia by prospective, large-scale, long-term observational cohort studies. These data may serve to guide treatment decisions and help to design controlled trials investigating treatment strategies in childhood epilepsy. METHODS: The results of the Dutch study of epilepsy in childhood will be compared with those of other studies. We will also discuss the potential consequences of these results for the "why" and "when" of the decision to start treatment. RESULTS: Recurrence after a solitary unprovoked seizure in childhood is about 50\%. Those with a recurrence have a similar outcome of their epilepsy compared to children presenting with multiple seizures, regardless whether they were treated after the first seizure or not. This argues in favour of postponing anti-epileptic drug (AED) treatment until at least a second seizure has occurred. After an unprovoked status epilepticus (SE), later outcome is not worse than after presentation with a short seizure. Therefore, long-term AED treatment after a single unprovoked SE may not be necessary either. The same holds true for children presenting with a short (less than one week) burst of unprovoked seizures. One quarter of them do not have recurrences and the final prognosis of children with recurrences does again not differ from the prognosis of the entire cohort. Findings in new-onset epilepsy further indicate that AED treatment can be safely omitted or at least postponed in about 15\%, especially those with only a small number of seizures before presentation, those with benign partial epilepsy and those with sporadic generalised tonic-clonic seizures. On the reverse side, three considerations might lead to the decision to start early and aggressive treatment: the dangers of the seizures, the chance of intractability and the possibility of intellectual decline caused by recurrent seizures or epileptic activity. In idiopathic generalised absence epilepsy, the risks of accidents and learning problems indeed prompt early AED treatment. A self-propagating mechanism of seizures promoting the occurrence of more seizures, in the end causing intractable epilepsy (Gowers), occurs only rarely. Real intractability is seen in only 5-15\% of the children with new-onset epilepsy. The chance of intractability is increased by variables like symptomatic aetiology, localisation-related epilepsy, and an early unfavourable course. Landau-Kleffner or continuous spikes and waves during sleep (CSWS) syndrome cause cognitive decline and syndromes like West, Lennox-Gastaut or Dravet's induce both psychomotor regression and intractability. In such cases, early aggressive treatment is indicated, including early consideration of the ketogenic diet, immunotherapy, vagus nerve stimulation and, if possible, referral for epilepsy surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Omitting or postponing treatment after a solitary seizure, an unprovoked SE, a single burst of seizures or multiple infrequent seizures usually does not worsen the prognosis. A poor prognosis and the consequent indication for early and aggressive treatment are dependent mainly upon the presence of variables like symptomatic aetiology, certain epilepsy types and syndromes, and the early evolution of the epilepsy in that particular child. Intellectual decline caused by seizures or epilepsy is rare and may be confined to certain specific and readily recognizable syndromes.},

Information on the occurrence of epilepsy in both members of a twin pair was obtained from 11900 pairs whose ages ranged from 12 to 41 years. Concordance rates, odds ratios and tetrachoric correlations were used to quantify the similarity of monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins. The sample was stratified by sex and separated into two age cohorts for analysis. Significantly higher probandwise concordance rates were found for MZ compared with DZ twins (0.37 and 0.08, P{\textless}0.01). Odds ratios and tetrachoric correlation showed similar pattern. An etiological model including additive genetic and individual specific environmental factors provided the best overall fit to the data, with 70 and 88\% of the liability to develop epilepsy being accounted for by genetic factors in the younger and older cohorts, respectively. Individual specific environmental factors explained the remaining 30 and 12\%, respectively. In conclusion, this study has confirmed the substantial impact, which genetic factors have in the etiology of epilepsy. The heritability of epilepsy is high and seems to increase with age.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: In observational research, equipoise concerns whether groups being compared are similar enough for valid inference. Empirical equipoise was previously proposed as a tool to assess patient similarity based on propensity scores (PS). We extended this work for multigroup observational studies. METHODS: We modified the tool to allow for multinomial exposures such that the proposed definition reduces to the original when there are only two groups. We illustrated how the tool can be used as a method to assess study design within three-group clinical examples. We then conducted three-group simulations to assess how the tool performed in a setting with residual confounding after PS weighting. RESULTS: In a clinical example based on rheumatoid arthritis, 44.5\% of the sample fell within the region of empirical equipoise when considering first-line biologics, whereas 57.7\% did so for second-line biologics, consistent with the expectation that a second-line design results in better equipoise. In a simulation where the unmeasured confounder had the same magnitude of association with the treatment as the measured confounders and a 25\% greater association with the outcome, the tool crossed the proposed threshold for empirical equipoise at a residual confounding of 20\% on the ratio scale. When the unmeasured variable had a twice larger association with treatment, the tool became less sensitive and crossed the threshold at a residual confounding of 30\%. CONCLUSION: Our proposed tool may be useful in guiding cohort identification in multigroup observational studies, particularly with similar effects of unmeasured and measured covariates on treatment and outcome.},

We conducted a large population-based case-control study in Denmark and investigated whether cancer diagnosis reduced the risk of developing PD even after adjusting for important risk factors including smoking, physical activity, and lifetime oestrogen status. Using probabilistic bias analysis we quantified the influence of survival bias. We estimated negative point estimates (ORs) between cancers and PD for all cancers except skin, female breast, and ill-defined and unspecified 0.85 (95\% CI 0.59-1.21); smoking-related cancers 0.75 (95\% CI 0.45-1.23); and cancers not related to smoking 0.82 (95\% CI 0.49-1.38) that are very similar to those previously reported for a much larger Danish register only based study, even though our confidence intervals include the null. These effect estimates shifted towards the null after accounting for survival bias but most bias-adjusted ORs remained below 1 within the range of priors considered in simulations. Overall, cancer patients have a lower risk of developing PD even after controlling for cancer-related lifestyles factors and correcting for survival bias.},

In this article, we illustrate use of the negative control exposure (NCE) approach to evaluate uncontrolled confounding bias in observational studies on pregnancy drug safety and explain the causal assumptions behind the method. We conducted an NCE analysis and evaluated the associations between maternal acetaminophen use during different exposure periods and ADHD among 8,856 children born in 1993-2005 to women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study II cohort. Information on regular maternal acetaminophen use was collected prospectively in biennial questionnaires. A total of 721 children (8.1\%) in the cohort had been diagnosed with ADHD as reported by the mothers. Our NCE analysis suggested that only acetaminophen use at the time of pregnancy was associated with childhood ADHD (odds ratio = 1.34, 95\% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.72), and the effect estimates for the 2 NCE periods (about 4 years before and 4 years after the pregnancy) were null. Our findings corroborate those of prior reports suggesting that prenatal acetaminophen exposure may influence neurodevelopment. The lack of an association between acetaminophen use in the pre- and postpregnancy exposure periods and ADHD provides assurance that uncontrolled time-invariant factors do not explain this association.},

Developmental exposure to endocrine disruptors could predispose individuals to weight gain. This study evaluated the associations between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and overweight in childhood. METHODS: A total of 30,127 (age 7) and 24,934 (age 11) children in the Danish National Birth Cohort born during 1996 to 2002 were studied. Mothers reported acetaminophen use in telephone interviews conducted during pregnancy, and children's BMI and waist circumference were reported by parents at 7 and 11 years. Differences for BMI z score and waist circumference were estimated, as well as risk ratios for overweight in girls and boys adjusting for indications of use and other confounders. RESULTS: There were no consistent associations found for prenatal acetaminophen exposure and BMI z score or waist circumference in girls and boys at both ages. Prenatal acetaminophen exposure was associated with overweight in girls at age 11 (risk ratio 1.31, 95\% CI: 1.10-1.56, if exposed in all three trimesters; P {\textless} 0.001 for cumulative weeks of exposure), but no association was found in boys.

We then used the findings to conduct sensitivity analysis and empirically offset the potential bias due to unmeasured mobility in the California Power Line Study dataset. RESULTS: As expected, the stronger the assumed relationship between mobility and exposure and outcome, the greater the potential bias. However, no scenario created a bias strong enough to completely explain away previously observed associations. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that uncontrolled confounding by residential mobility had some impact on the estimated effect of EMF exposures on childhood leukemia, but that it was unlikely to be the primary explanation behind previously observed largely consistent, but unexplained associations.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Little is known about what interventions worked or did not work in slowing the obesity epidemic. The long-term comparative effectiveness of environmental and behavioral public health interventions for obesity and type 2 diabetes prevention over an individual's life course is relatively unexplored. The potential impact and long-term collective effectiveness of environmental and behavioral interventions on obesity and type 2 diabetes throughout the life course was evaluated. METHODS: The Virtual Los Angeles Obesity Model developed in 2016 was used to estimate the incidence and prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes under current and hypothetical interventions among 98,000 individuals born in 2009 and followed from birth to age 65 years. Analyses were performed in 2016 and completed in 2018. RESULTS: The 48-year risk of type 2 diabetes was 0.533 (95\% CI=0.446, 0.629) under the natural course, 0.451 (95\% CI=0.334, 0.570) under the physical activity intervention, and 0.443 (95\% CI=0.389, 0.495) under the fast-food intervention. The 64-year risk of obesity was 0.892 (95\% CI=0.879, 0.903) under the natural course, 0.876 (95\% CI=0.850, 0.899) under the physical activity intervention, and 0.864 (95\% CI=0.856, 0.873) under the fast-food intervention. The other interventions had little or no long-term effects. When all the interventions were applied, the population risk ratios were 0.942 (95\% CI=0.914, 0.967) and 0.634 (95\% CI=0.484, 0.845) for obesity and type 2 diabetes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing health interventions continuously throughout the life span and in combination with other interventions could substantially halt the obesity and the type 2 diabetes epidemics.},

	doi = {10.1002/pds.4789},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Because preapproval clinical trials typically exclude pregnant women, the evidence on drug safety during pregnancy required to inform drug labeling must come from postapproval controlled observational studies. Common designs have included pregnancy registries and case-control studies. Recently, pregnancy cohorts nested within healthcare utilization databases are increasingly being used. Despite clear advantages, these databases share some important limitations that may threaten the validity of studies emerging from them. METHODS: This paper describes the distinctive methodological aspects of conducting drug safety studies in healthcare utilization databases with special emphasis on design and analytic approaches to minimize biases. RESULTS: We describe considerations for study design, cohort definition, and follow-up. We then address issues related to exposure ascertainment based on prescription fills, including the importance of the etiologically relevant window and of properly accounting for preterm births. This is followed by a discussion of advantages and challenges when ascertaining maternal and infant outcomes based on secondary data. We then explore useful approaches to address confounding within the context of pregnancy research and of the potential for selection bias when restricting the cohort to live births. Finally, we consider issues related to external validity and statistical significance. The examples are mainly drawn from a pregnancy cohort nested in the Medicaid Analytic Extract. CONCLUSIONS: The approaches presented provide guidance regarding the important methodological considerations that need to be attended to in order to generate valid, minimally biased risk when using large healthcare utilization databases for drug safety surveillance in pregnancy.},

Although the three statistical paradoxes occur in different types of variables, they share the same characteristic: the association between two variables can be reversed, diminished, or enhanced when another variable is statistically controlled for. Understanding the concepts and theory behind these paradoxes provides insights into some controversial or contradictory research findings.

	abstract = {Many common problems in epidemiologic and clinical research involve estimating the effect of an exposure on an outcome while blocking the exposure's effect on an intermediate variable. Effects of this kind are termed direct effects. Estimation of direct effects is typically the goal of research aimed at understanding mechanistic pathways by which an exposure acts to cause or prevent disease, as well as in many other settings. Although multivariable regression is commonly used to estimate direct effects, this approach requires assumptions beyond those required for the estimation of total causal effects. In addition, when the exposure and intermediate variables interact to cause disease, multivariable regression estimates a particular type of direct effect-the effect of an exposure on an outcome when the intermediate is fixed at a specified level. Using the counterfactual framework, we distinguish this definition of a direct effect (controlled direct effect) from an alternative definition, in which the effect of the exposure on the intermediate is blocked, but the intermediate is otherwise allowed to vary as it would in the absence of exposure (natural direct effect). We illustrate the difference between controlled and natural direct effects using several examples. We present an estimation approach for natural direct effects that can be implemented using standard statistical software, and we review the assumptions underlying our approach (which are less restrictive than those proposed by previous authors).},

This is not surprising because reversal or change in magnitude is common in conditional analysis. At the heart of the phenomenon of change in magnitude, with or without reversal of effect estimate, is the question of which to use: the unadjusted (combined table) or adjusted (sub-table) estimate. Hence, Simpson's paradox and related phenomena are a problem of covariate selection and adjustment (when to adjust or not) in the causal analysis of non-experimental data. It cannot be overemphasized that although these paradoxes reveal the perils of using statistical criteria to guide causal analysis, they hold neither the explanations of the phenomenon they depict nor the pointers on how to avoid them.

The paper focuses on the logical connections among the different types of models and on the different strengths of each approach. Graphical models can illustrate qualitative population assumptions and sources of bias not easily seen with other approaches; sufficient-component cause models can illustrate specific hypotheses about mechanisms of action; and potential-outcome and structural-equations models provide a basis for quantitative analysis of effects. The different approaches provide complementary perspectives, and can be employed together to improve causal interpretations of conventional statistical results.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) may potentially disturb fetal Leydig cell hormone production and male genital development. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to study the associations between levels of amniotic fluid PFOS, fetal steroid hormone, and insulin-like factor 3 (INSL3) and the prevalence of cryptorchidism and hypospadias. METHODS: Using the Danish National Patient Registry, we selected 270 cryptorchidism cases, 75 hypospadias cases, and 300 controls with stored maternal amniotic fluid samples available in a Danish pregnancy-screening biobank (1980-1996). We used mass spectrometry to measure PFOS in amniotic fluid from 645 persons and steroid hormones in samples from 545 persons. INSL3 was measured by immunoassay from 475 persons. Associations between PFOS concentration in amniotic fluid, hormone levels, and genital malformations were assessed by confounder-adjusted linear and logistic regression. RESULTS: The highest tertile of PFOS exposure ({\textgreater} 1.4 ng/mL) in amniotic fluid was associated with a 40\% (95\% CI: -69, -11\%) lower INSL3 level and an 18\% (95\% CI: 7, 29\%) higher testosterone level compared with the lowest tertile ({\textless} 0.8 ng/mL). Amniotic fluid PFOS concentration was not associated with cryptorchidism or hypospadias. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental PFOS exposure was associated with steroid hormone and INSL3 concentrations in amniotic fluid, but was not associated with cryptorchidism or hypospadias in our study population. Additional studies are needed to determine whether associations with fetal hormone levels may have long-term implications for reproductive health.

SETTING: University hospital. PATIENT(S): Population-based cohort of 256 women: 180 were users and 76 were nonusers of hormonal contraceptives. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Antral follicles, androgens, age at menarche, and duration and regularity of menstrual cycle. RESULT(S): AMH levels were lower among users of hormonal contraceptives compared to nonusers. Among nonusers, women with AMH levels in the upper tertile had 55\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 22\%-99\%) higher levels of total T and 8\% (95\% CI = 2\%-15\%) longer menstrual cycles than women with AMH levels in the lower tertile. An increase of 1 ng/mL in AMH was associated with 45\% (95\% CI = 6\%-97\%) higher prevalence of irregular menstrual cycles. These associations were not seen among users of hormonal contraceptives. A strong relationship between AMH and follicle number was found in both users and nonusers. CONCLUSION(S): AMH measurements were found to be applicable in evaluation of the reproductive function of young women.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To generate estimates of the association between markers of ovarian aging and natural fertility in a community sample at risk for ovarian aging. METHODS: Women aged 30-44 years with no history of infertility who had been trying to conceive for less than 3 months provided early-follicular phase serum and urine (N=100). Subsequently, these women kept a diary to record menstrual bleeding and intercourse and conducted standardized pregnancy testing for up to 6 months. Serum was analyzed for estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), antimullerian hormone, and inhibin B. Urine was analyzed for FSH and estrone 3-glucuronide. Diary data on menstrual cycle day and patterns of intercourse were used to calculate day-specific fecundability ratios. RESULTS: Sixty-three percent of participants conceived within 6 months. After adjusting for age, 18 women (18\%) with serum antimullerian hormone levels of 0.7 ng/mL or less had significantly reduced fecundability given intercourse on a fertile day compared with women with higher antimullerian hormone levels (fecundability ratio 0.38; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.08-0.91). The day-specific fecundability for women with early-follicular phase serum FSH values greater than 10 milli-international units/mL compared with women with lower FSH levels was also reduced, although nonsignificantly (11\% of women affected; fecundability ratio 0.44; 95\% CI 0.08-1.10). The association with urinary FSH was weaker (27\% women affected; fecundability ratio 0.61; 95\% CI 0.26-1.26), and the associations for the other markers were weaker still. CONCLUSION: Early-follicular phase antimullerian hormone appears to be associated with natural fertility in the general population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Organic solvents have been suspected to exert detrimental effects on human spermiogenesis. Styrene, which is both mutagenic and neurotoxic, was selected as a suitable organic solvent for further assessment of a possible effect on semen quality and sperm DNA damage. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Semen samples were collected from 23 reinforced plastics workers at the time of employment and after 6 months of styrene exposure and from 21 nonexposed farmers. Intra-individual changes in conventional semen parameters and sperm-DNA denaturation patterns were related to the internal dose of styrene exposure as measured by postshift urinary mandelic acid. RESULTS: A statistically significant decline in sperm density was seen during styrene exposure from 63.5 to 46.0 million sperm/ml, whereas no decline was seen in the nonexposed subjects. The total sperm count was almost halved from an initial value of 175 million sperm/ejaculate. However, no relationship was apparent when the sperm parameters were related to internal levels of exposure. However, an exposure-response relationship was shown for DNA-denaturation patterns, but the numbers were small. CONCLUSION: A declining sperm count following styrene exposure is suggested. However, the findings of the internal and external comparisons are inconsistent, and this may be due to the high intraindividual variability of semen parameters and the limited study size but may also be attributable to a weak internal exposure gradient. Spermatogenesis may be vulnerable to styrene exposure. However, due to the small numbers these findings are only preliminary.},

	abstract = {A few studies indicate that exposure to maternal smoking during fetal life decreases semen quality in adult life, but the results are inconsistent and retrospectively collected smoking data were used in most studies. From a Danish pregnancy cohort established in 1984-1987, 347 of 5,109 sons were selected according to their exposure to tobacco smoke in fetal life. From February 2005 to January 2006, a semen sample from the 347 men was analyzed for conventional semen characteristics according to standardized criteria by using a mobile laboratory. The authors found an inverse association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and total sperm count (p = 0.002). Men exposed to more than 19 cigarettes daily during pregnancy had approximately 19\% lower semen volume (p = 0.04), 38\% lower total sperm count (p = 0.11), and 17\% lower sperm concentration (p = 0.47) compared with unexposed men. The odds ratio for oligospermia was 2.16 (95\% confidence interval: 0.68, 6.87) among exposed men compared with the unexposed. No associations were found for sperm motility or morphology. These results indicate that prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke may have an adverse effect on semen quality and, if these associations are causal, they could explain some of the reported differences between populations and secular changes in semen quality.},

The majority of studies have been conducted among selected populations of infertility clients or among occupational cohorts including a limited number of participants. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of semen quality and serum concentration of 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (CB-153) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl)-ethylene (p,p'-DDE) among 763 men. We included men from all regions in Greenland (n = 194), fishermen from Sweden (n = 185), inhabitants of the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine (n = 195), and inhabitants of the city of Warsaw, Poland (n = 189). Blood samples were analyzed for CB-153 and p,p'-DDE using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and adjusted for serum lipids. RESULTS: Sperm concentration was not impaired with increasing serum CB-153 or p,p'-DDE levels in any of the separate groups or overall. Similarly, the proportion of morphologically normal sperm was not associated with either CB-153 or p,p'-DDE blood concentration. However, sperm motility was inversely related to CB-153 concentration in Greenland and the Swedish fishermen population. Across all 4 regions, the sperm motility decreased on average by 3.6\% (95\% confidence interval = 1.7\% to 5.6\%) per one-unit increase in the log of blood CB-153 (ng/g lipid). The concentration of p,p'-DDE was negatively associated with sperm motility in the Greenlandic population and in the compiled dataset. CONCLUSION: Adult exposure to persistent organochlorine pollutants within the ranges observed in the present study is not likely to cause reduction in sperm concentration or morphology. However, higher exposure may be associated with impaired sperm motility.},

XER and XAR activity were measured in serum samples cleared for endogenous steroid hormones and AhR activity in raw lipophilic serum extracts free of proteins. RESULTS: All together, 319 men from Warsaw (Poland), Greenland, Kharkiv (Ukraine), and Sweden provided semen and blood samples. No strong and consistent associations between xenobiotic activity and semen quality measures were observed in the four populations. However, when the data were combined across populations sperm concentration increased 40\% per unit increase in XER activity [95\% confidence interval (CI), 1-79\%] in the subgroup with XER activity below the reference level. Among subjects with XER activity above the reference level an increase of 14\% (95\% CI, 2-28\%) was found. Furthermore, an increase of 10\% motile sperm per unit increase in XER activity below reference level (95\% CI, 0.2-20) was found. We are unable to exclude that the associations are chance findings.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Persistent organochlorine pollutants (POPs) may interfere with reproductive function but direct evidence in humans is very limited. METHODS: Fertility was examined in four regions with contrasting blood levels of POPs. Pregnant women and their partners in Warsaw (Poland), Kharkiv (Ukraine) and Greenland were consecutively enrolled during antenatal visits. Swedish fishermen and their spouses were recruited separately and independently of current pregnancy. Lipid adjusted serum concentrations of 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (CB-153) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl)-ethylene (DDE) were available for both partners. Time to pregnancy interviews were obtained among 2269 women and 798 men provided a semen sample. RESULTS: Inuits had high levels of both POP markers, Swedish fishermen were high in CB-153 but low in DDE, men from Kharkiv were high in DDE and low in CB-153 while men from Warsaw were low in CB-153 and had intermediate DDE levels. Compared to Warsaw couples, fecundability was reduced among couples from Kharkiv [adjusted fecundability ratio (FR) 0.64 (95\% CI 0.5-0.8)] and elevated in Swedish fishermen families [FR 1.26 (95\% CI 1.0-1.6)]. Adjusted geometric means of sperm counts and morphology did not differ between regions while sperm motility was higher in men living in Warsaw. CONCLUSION: We observed regional differences in time to pregnancy and sperm motility that may be related to regional differences in POP blood levels, but other interpretations are also plausible. In particular, differences in access to safe contraception and in the prevalence of contraceptive failures are most likely to bias comparisons of time to pregnancy.},

The chemicals can cross the placenta and may interfere with endogenous hormonal homeostasis. OBJECTIVES: To investigate effects on female reproduction following intrauterine exposure to selected biopersistent organochlorines. METHODS: We used data from a Danish pregnancy cohort with follow-up on 436 eligible daughters at approximately 20years of age. Information on age of menarche (n=335), menstrual cycle length (n=230) and serum concentrations of reproductive hormones (n=243) was obtained. Number of antral follicles was counted by vaginal ultrasound (n=147). Of 244 daughters who attended clinical examination, 170 used hormonal contraceptives and 74 were non-users. Concentrations of p,p'-DDE, HCB and six PCB congeners were analysed in maternal serum samples obtained in pregnancy week 30. RESULTS: Age of menarche and menstrual cycle length were found not to be statistically significant associated with prenatal organochlorine exposure. Among non-users of hormonal contraceptives with information on antral follicle number (n=43), daughters exposed to the highest tertile of p,p'-DDE had 28\% (95\% confidence interval (95\% CI): 5; 46\%) lower follicle number compared to the low-level exposed reference group. Those exposed to medium and higher levels of HCB had 30\% (95\% CI: 5; 48\%) and 28\% (95\% CI: 7; 44\%) lower follicle number compared to the reference group. Furthermore, maternal serum HCB concentrations were inversely associated with free androgen index among non-users of hormonal contraceptives (n=73). These associations were not found in users of hormonal contraceptives. CONCLUSIONS: Among non-users of hormonal contraceptives, we found indications of adverse long-term effects on female reproduction following prenatal exposure to biopersistent organochlorines. These findings may have wide implications for public health as intrauterine exposure occurs worldwide.},

	doi = {10.1093/humupd/dmw036},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: More than 20 years ago, it was hypothesized that exposure to prenatal and early postnatal environmental xenobiotics with the potential to disrupt endogenous hormone signaling might be on the causal path to cryptorchidism, hypospadias, low sperm count and testicular cancer. Several consensus statements and narrative reviews in recent years have divided the scientific community and have elicited a call for systematic transparent reviews. We aimed to fill this gap in knowledge in the field of male reproductive disorders. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: The aim of this study was to systematically synthesize published data on the risk of cryptorchidism, hypospadias, low sperm counts and testicular cancer following in utero or infant exposure to chemicals that have been included on the European Commission's list of Category 1 endocrine disrupting chemicals defined as having documented adverse effects due to endocrine disruption in at least one intact organism. SEARCH METHODS: A systematic literature search for original peer reviewed papers was performed in the databases PubMed and Embase to identify epidemiological studies reporting associations between the outcomes of interest and exposures documented by biochemical analyses of biospecimens including maternal blood or urine, placenta or fat tissue as well as amnion fluid, cord blood or breast milk; this was followed by meta-analysis of quantitative data. OUTCOMES: The literature search resulted in 1314 references among which we identified 33 papers(28 study populations) fulfilling the eligibility criteria. These provided 85 risk estimates of links between persistent organic pollutants and rapidly metabolized compounds (phthalates and Bisphenol A) and male reproductive disorders. The overall odds ratio (OR) across all exposures and outcomes was 1.11 (95\% CI 0.91-1.35). When assessing four specific chemical subgroups with sufficient data for meta-analysis for all outcomes, we found that exposure to one of the four compounds, p,p'-DDE, was related to an elevated risk: OR 1.35 (95\% CI 1.04-1.74). The data did not indicate that this increased risk was driven by any specific disorder. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The current epidemiological evidence is compatible with a small increased risk of male reproductive disorders following prenatal and postnatal exposure to some persistent environmental chemicals classified as endocrine disruptors but the evidence is limited. Future epidemiological studies may change the weight of the evidence in either direction. No evidence of distortion due to publication bias was found, but exposure-response relationships are not evident. There are insufficient data on rapidly metabolized endocrine disruptors and on specific exposure-outcome relations. A particular data gap is evident with respect to delayed effects on semen quality and testicular cancer. Although high quality epidemiological studies are still sparse, future systematic and transparent reviews may provide pieces of evidence contributing to the narrative and weight of the evidence assessments in the field.},

	doi = {10.1093/humrep/dew291},
	abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Is female exposure to phthalate metabolites associated with reduced fecundity, as estimated by prolonged time to pregnancy (TTP)? SUMMARY ANSWER: Female exposure to monoethyl phthalate (MEP) but not monobutyl phthalate (MBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) and monoethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) was associated with a longer TTP. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Male exposure to phthalates is potentially associated with adverse effects on human fecundity in epidemiological studies, but little is known about the potential effects on female reproduction. STUDY DESIGN SIZE AND DURATION: A cohort study with prospective data based on 229 women from a Danish cohort of 430 first pregnancy planning couples enrolled in 1992-1994. In 2009, urinary analyses of phthalate metabolites were performed on stored urine samples from this cohort. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING AND METHODS: We analyzed MEP, MBP, MBzP and MEHP in female morning spot urine samples collected daily during the first 10 days of menstrual cycles after discontinuation of contraception. The exposure assessment was based on the mean of two measurements from each woman collected in a period of 6 menstrual cycles. We used Cox regression with discrete time to estimate fecundability ratios (FRs) and 95\% CI in relation to the average urine metabolite concentration exposure level, controlled for age and BMI, and the time-varying variables smoking and alcohol. MAIN RESULT AND ROLE OF CHANCE: Urinary concentration of MEP was associated with a decreased fecundity (adjusted FR 0.79; 95\% CI: 0.63; 0.99) corresponding to a 21\% decreased probability of conception for each natural log (ln) unit increase in MEP. No significant association with TTP was found for MBP, MBzP and MEHP. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: Subfertile women were overrepresented in the study population due to exclusion of 77 high fertile women who became pregnant in the first cycle when urine collection began. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results suggest that female exposure to MEP may have an adverse effect on female fecundity, but these findings need to be replicated in a larger and newer cohort study with sufficient exposure contrast if the use of diethyl phthalate (DEP) and thereby MEP in the future potentially should be regulated in cosmetics and industrial consumer products.

The authors investigated whether trimming large weights downward can improve the performance of propensity score weighting and whether the benefits of trimming differ by propensity score estimation method. In a simulation study, the authors examined the performance of weight trimming following logistic regression, classification and regression trees (CART), boosted CART, and random forests to estimate propensity score weights. Results indicate that although misspecified logistic regression propensity score models yield increased bias and standard errors, weight trimming following logistic regression can improve the accuracy and precision of final parameter estimates. In contrast, weight trimming did not improve the performance of boosted CART and random forests. The performance of boosted CART and random forests without weight trimming was similar to the best performance obtainable by weight trimmed logistic regression estimated propensity scores. While trimming may be used to optimize propensity score weights estimated using logistic regression, the optimal level of trimming is difficult to determine. These results indicate that although trimming can improve inferences in some settings, in order to consistently improve the performance of propensity score weighting, analysts should focus on the procedures leading to the generation of weights (i.e., proper specification of the propensity score model) rather than relying on ad-hoc methods such as weight trimming.},

However, the literature on these results is fast-growing and complex, which may be confusing to researchers unfamiliar with causal inference or unfamiliar with mediation. The goal of this paper is to help ease the understanding and adoption of causal mediation analysis. It starts by highlighting a key difference between the causal inference and traditional approaches to mediation analysis and making a case for the need for explicit causal thinking and the causal inference approach in mediation analysis. It then explains in as-plain-as-possible language existing effect types, paying special attention to motivating these effects with different types of research questions, and using concrete examples for illustration. This presentation differentiates two perspectives (or purposes of analysis): the explanatory perspective (aiming to explain the total effect) and the interventional perspective (asking questions about hypothetical interventions on the exposure and mediator, or hypothetically modified exposures). For the latter perspective, the paper proposes leveraging a general class of interventional effects that contains as special cases most of the usual effect types -- interventional direct and indirect effects, controlled direct effects and also a generalized interventional direct effect type, as well as the total effect and overall effect. This general class allows flexible effect definitions which better match many research questions than the standard interventional direct and indirect effects.},

Full matching on the propensity score has emerged as a particularly effective and flexible method for utilizing all available data, and creating well-balanced treatment and comparison groups. However, full matching has been used infrequently with binary outcomes, and relatively little work has investigated the performance of full matching when estimating effects on binary outcomes. This paper describes methods that can be used for estimating the effect of treatment on binary outcomes when using full matching. It then used Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the performance of these methods based on full matching (with and without a caliper), and compared their performance with that of nearest neighbour matching (with and without a caliper) and inverse probability of treatment weighting. The simulations varied the prevalence of the treatment and the strength of association between the covariates and treatment assignment. Results indicated that all of the approaches work well when the strength of confounding is relatively weak. With stronger confounding, the relative performance of the methods varies, with nearest neighbour matching with a caliper showing consistently good performance across a wide range of settings.

	abstract = {Background and Aims
Confounding is a major concern in nonexperimental studies of endoscopic interventions and can lead to biased estimates of the effects of treatment. Propensity score methods, which are commonly used in the pharmacoepidemiology literature, can effectively control for baseline confounding by balancing measured baseline confounders and risk factors and creating comparable populations of treated and untreated patients.
Methods
We propose the following 5-step checklist to guide the use and evaluation of propensity score methods: (1) select covariates, (2) assess “Table 1” balance in risk factors before propensity score implementation, (3) estimate and implement the propensity score in the study cohort, (4) reassess “Table 1” balance in risk factors after propensity score implementation, and (5) critically evaluate differences between matched and unmatched patients after propensity score implementation. We then applied this checklist to an endoscopy example using a study cohort of 411 adults with newly diagnosed eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), some of whom were treated with esophageal dilation.
Results
We identified 156 patients, aged 18 and older, who were treated with esophageal dilation, and 255 patients who were nondilated. We successfully matched 148 (95\%) dilated patients to nondilated patients who had a propensity score within 0.1, based on patient age, sex, race, self-reported food allergy, and presence of narrowing at baseline endoscopy. Crude imbalances were observed before propensity score matching in several baseline covariates, including age, sex, and narrowing; however, propensity score matching was successful in achieving balance across all measured covariates.
Conclusions
We provide an introduction to propensity score methods, including a straightforward checklist for implementing propensity score methods in nonexperimental studies of treatment effectiveness. Moreover, we demonstrate the advantage of using “Table 1” as a simple but effective diagnostic tool for evaluating the success of propensity score methods in an applied example of esophageal dilation in EoE.},

	abstract = {AbstractPropensity scores are widely adopted in observational research because they enable adjustment for high-dimensional confounders without requiring models for their association with the outcome of interest. The results of statistical analyses based on stratification, matching or inverse weighting by the propensity score are therefore less susceptible to model extrapolation than those based solely on outcome regression models. This is attractive because extrapolation in outcome regression models may be alarming, yet difficult to diagnose, when the exposed and unexposed individuals have very different covariate distributions.Standard regression adjustment for the propensity score forms an alternative to the aforementioned propensity score methods, but the benefits of this are less clear because it still involves modelling the outcome in addition to the propensity score. In this article, we develop novel insights into the properties of this adjustment method. We demonstrate that standard tests of the null hypothesis of no exposure effect (based on robust variance estimators), as well as particular standardised effects obtained from such adjusted regression models, are robust against misspecification of the outcome model when a propensity score model is correctly specified; they are thus not vulnerable to the aforementioned problem of extrapolation. We moreover propose efficient estimators for these standardised effects, which retain a useful causal interpretation even when the propensity score model is misspecified, provided the outcome regression model is correctly specified.

	abstract = {Background: 
        Propensity scores are useful for confounding adjustment in the commonly observed setting of many potential confounders, frequent exposure, and rare events. However, with few exposed outcomes to inform covariate selection and many candidate confounders, optimal approaches to construct and implement propensity-score–based confounding adjustment remain unclear.
        Methods: 
        In a cohort study on the effect of anticonvulsant drugs on cardiovascular risk among adult patients from the HealthCore Integrated Research Database, we compared the performance for confounding control of various covariate-selection strategies for propensity-score estimation (expert knowledge only, expert knowledge informed by empirical covariate selection via high-dimensional propensity-score, and high-dimensional propensity-score empirical specification only) and propensity-score–based adjustment methods (propensity-score-matching and propensity-score-decile stratification). This article focuses on the first 90 days of follow-up because any treatment effect identified in this temporal window almost certainty originates from residual confounding rather than pharmacologic action.
        Results: 
        We identified 166,031 new users and 564 ischemic cardiovascular events. Among those, 12,580 patients initiated anticonvulsants that strongly induce cytochrome P450 enzymes and experienced 68 events. The unadjusted hazard ratio was 1.72 (95\% confidence interval = 1.34–2.22). Adjustment for investigator-identified covariates led to 41\% to 59\% reductions in the hazard ratio; adjustment for both investigator-identified and high-dimensional propensity-score empirically identified covariates led to larger reductions (54\% to 72\%). A selection strategy based on high-dimensional propensity-score empirical specification alone produced less-attenuated and more-volatile hazard ratio estimates. This volatility seemed to be slightly attenuated in a trimmed propensity-score–stratified analysis.
        Conclusions: 
        The high-dimensional propensity-score algorithm complements expert knowledge for confounding adjustment, but in settings with few exposed outcomes, its performance without investigator-specified covariates is less clear and may be associated with an increased likelihood of bias. In our example, investigator specification of variables combined with high-dimensional propensity-score empirical selection and the use of trimmed propensity-score–stratified analysis seem to improve effect estimation. Plotting the relation of effect estimates to the increasing number of empirical covariates is a useful diagnostic.},

In the former case, although a typical application uses the same set of covariates in the PS and the stratification post-PS balancing, several studies adjust for additional confounders in the stratification while ignoring the covariates that have been balanced by the PS. We show the bias arising from such partial adjustments for distinct sets of confounders by PS and regression or stratification. Namely, the stratification or regression after PS balancing causes imbalance in the confounders that have been balanced by the PS if PS-balanced confounders are ignored. We empirically illustrate the bias in the Rotterdam Tumor Bank, in which strong confounders distort the association between chemotherapy and recurrence-free survival. If additional covariates are adjusted for after PS balancing, the covariate sets conditioned in PS should be again adjusted for, or PS should be reestimated by including the additional covariates to avoid bias owing to covariate imbalance.},

All identiﬁable causal eﬀects can be derived using the rules of do-calculus, but the rules themselves do not give any direct indication whether the eﬀect in question is identiﬁable or not. Shpitser and Pearl (2006b) constructed an algorithm for identifying joint interventional distributions in causal models, which contain unobserved variables and induce directed acyclic graphs. This algorithm can be seen as a repeated application of the rules of do-calculus and known properties of probabilities, and it ultimately either derives an expression for the causal distribution, or fails to identify the eﬀect, in which case the eﬀect is non-identiﬁable. In this paper, the R package causaleﬀect is presented, which provides an implementation of this algorithm. Functionality of causaleﬀect is also demonstrated through examples.},

We discuss several subtle problems associated with matched case-control studies that do not arise or are minor in matched cohort studies: (1) matching, even for non-confounders, can create selection bias; (2) matching distorts dose-response relations between matching variables and the outcome; (3) unbiased estimation requires accounting for the actual matching protocol as well as for any residual confounding effects; (4) for efficiency, identically matched groups should be collapsed; (5) matching may harm precision and power; (6) matched analyses may suffer from sparse-data bias, even when using basic sparse-data methods. These problems support advice to limit case-control matching to a few strong well-measured confounders, which would devolve to no matching if no such confounders are measured. On the positive side, odds ratio modification by matched variables can be assessed in matched case-control studies without further data, and when one knows either the distribution of the matching factors or their relation to the outcome in the source population, one can estimate and study patterns in absolute rates. Throughout, we emphasize distinctions from the more intuitive impacts of cohort matching.},

Three principles of comparability are described: 1) study base, that all comparisons be made within the study base; 2) deconfounding, that comparisons of the effects of the levels of exposure on disease risk not be distorted by the effects of other factors; and 3) comparable accuracy, that any errors in measurement of exposure be nondifferential between cases and controls. These principles, if adhered to in a study, can reduce selection, confounding, and information bias, respectively. The principles, however, are constrained by an additional efficiency principle regarding resources and time. Most problems and controversies in control selection reflect trade-offs among these four principles.},

We included known risk factors to ascertain whether our findings are comparable with those of previous studies. METHODS: Population-based case-control study including 339 cases with community-onset ESBL E. coli UTI in 2007-2012, 3390 non-ESBL E. coli UTI controls and 3390 population controls. We investigated potential risk factors by estimating ORs and 95\% CIs adjusting for sex, age and co-morbidity. RESULTS: Comparing cases with non-ESBL E. coli UTI, PPI use yielded an OR of 1.6 (95\% CI 1.2-2.0) and antibiotic exposure gave an OR of 1.4 (95\% CI 1.1-1.8); these were driven by nitrofurantoin (OR 1.8; 95\% CI 1.3-2.6) and macrolides (OR 1.7; 95\% CI 1.2-2.3). Other risk factors included previous hospitalization with one or two and more than two hospitalizations versus none yielding ORs of 1.9 (95\% CI 1.4-2.5) and 4.6 (95\% CI 3.2-6.8), recent surgery (OR 2.0; 95\% CI 1.5-2.8), renal disease (OR 2.2; 95\% CI 1.4-3.4), chronic pulmonary disease (OR 1.4; 95\% CI 1.0-2.0) and cancer (OR 1.5; 95\% CI 1.1-2.1). Comparing cases with population controls, we found that most risk factors were also risk factors for non-ESBL UTI. CONCLUSIONS: ESBL E. coli UTI were associated with previous hospitalization and surgery. Nitrofurantoin and macrolides augmented the risk. PPIs had a moderate effect but may be important facilitators of ESBL carriage due to their widespread use.},

	abstract = {Importance: Individuals with mental disorders often develop comorbidity over time. Past studies of comorbidity have often restricted analyses to a subset of disorders and few studies have provided absolute risks of later comorbidity. Objectives: To undertake a comprehensive study of comorbidity within mental disorders, by providing temporally ordered age- and sex-specific pairwise estimates between the major groups of mental disorders, and to develop an interactive website to visualize all results and guide future research and clinical practice. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study included all individuals born in Denmark between January 1, 1900, and December 31, 2015, and living in the country between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2016. The analyses were conducted between June 2017 and May 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Danish health registers were used to identify mental disorders, which were examined within the broad 10-level International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, subchapter groups (eg, codes F00-F09 and F10-F19). For each temporally ordered pair of disorders, overall and lagged hazard ratios and 95\% CIs were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Absolute risks were estimated using competing risks survival analyses. Estimates for each sex were generated. Results: A total of 5940778 persons were included in this study (2958293 men and 2982485 women; mean [SD] age at beginning of follow-up, 32.1 [25.4] years). They were followed up for 83.9 million person-years. All mental disorders were associated with an increased risk of all other mental disorders when adjusting for sex, age, and calendar time (hazard ratios ranging from 2.0 [95\% CI, 1.7-2.4] for prior intellectual disabilities and later eating disorders to 48.6 [95\% CI, 46.6-50.7] for prior developmental disorders and later intellectual disabilities). The hazard ratios were temporally patterned, with higher estimates during the first year after the onset of the first disorder, but with persistently elevated rates during the entire observation period. Some disorders were associated with substantial absolute risks of developing specific later disorders (eg, 30.6\% [95\% CI, 29.3\%-32.0\%] of men and 38.4\% [95\% CI, 37.5\%-39.4\%] of women with a diagnosis of mood disorders before age 20 years developed neurotic disorders within the following 5 years). Conclusions and Relevance: Comorbidity within mental disorders is pervasive, and the risk persists over time. This study provides disorder-, sex-, and age-specific relative and absolute risks of the comorbidity of mental disorders.

Specifically, this study estimates the prevalence of patients with a newly registered diagnosis of ADHD over a 5-year period, and the prevalence of all patients with a registered ADHD diagnoses over a 6-year period in Sweden.
METHOD: Two population-based registries were used as data sources for this study; the National Patient Register (NPR) and the Prescribed Drug Register (PDR). The international Classification of Diseases 10th Revison (ICD-10) was used to identify patients with ADHD.
RESULTS: The annual prevalence of ADHD in the general population of Sweden was found to be 1.1 per 1,000 persons in the year 2006 increasing to 4.8 per 1,000 persons in 2011. The corresponding prevalence for newly diagnosed patients increased from 0.6 per 1,000 persons in 2007 to 1.3 per 1,000 persons in 2011. The majority of diagnosed patients received pharmacological treatment, with methylphenidate being the most common dispensed drug. Comorbidities in the autism spectrum were most common for younger patients, while substance abuse, anxiety, and personality disorder were the most common comorbidities in older patients.
CONCLUSION: From 2006 to 2011, the number of patients diagnosed with ADHD has increased in Sweden over all ages. The majority of patients diagnosed with ADHD in Sweden received a pharmacological treatment regardless of age. An ADHD diagnosis was often accompanied with psychiatric comorbidity.},

	abstract = {Numerous observational studies have shown that infants born after short interpregnancy intervals (the interval between birth and subsequent conception) are more likely to experience adverse perinatal outcomes than infants born following longer intervals. Yet it remains controversial whether the link between short interpregnancy interval and adverse outcomes is causal or is confounded by factors such as low socioeconomic position, inadequate access to health care, and unintended pregnancy. Sibling comparison studies, which use a woman as her own control by comparing exposure and outcome status of her different pregnancies (i.e., comparing sibling offspring), have gained popularity as a strategy to reduce confounding by these difficult-to-measure factors that are nevertheless relatively stable within women. A variant of this approach, used by Regan et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2019;188(1):9-16) and reported in this issue of the Journal, is a maternally matched design based on a single interpregnancy interval per woman. Using real and simulated data, we highlight underappreciated shortcomings of these designs that could limit the validity of study findings. In particular, we illustrate how the single-interval variant appears to derive estimates from comparisons between different mothers, not within mothers. Future studies of optimal birth spacing using sibling comparison designs should examine in detail the potential consequences of these methodological limitations.},

	abstract = {Background The association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the development of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the offspring may be due to bias. Objectives The primary objective was to assess the role of potential unmeasured confounding in the estimation of the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD, through bias analysis. The secondary objective was to assess the roles of selection bias and exposure misclassification. Data sources We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library up to December 2018. Study selection and data extraction We included observational studies examining the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD. Synthesis We meta-analysed data across studies, using random-effects model. We conducted a bias analysis to studies that did not adjust for important confounders, to explore systematic errors related to unmeasured confounding, selection bias, and exposure misclassification. Results The search resulted in seven studies included in our meta-analysis. When adjusted estimates were pooled across all studies, the risk ratio (RR) for ADHD was 1.35 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.25, 1.46; I2 = 48\%). Sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding in this meta-analysis showed that a confounder of 1.69 on the RR scale would reduce to 10\% the proportion of studies with a true effect size of RR {\textgreater}1.10. Unmeasured confounding bias analysis decreased the point estimate in five of the seven studies and increased in two studies, suggesting that the observed association could be confounded by parental ADHD. Unadjusted and bias-corrected risk ratios (bcRRs) were: RR = 1.34, bcRR = 1.13; RR = 1.51, bcRR = 1.17; RR = 1.63, bcRR = 1.38; RR = 1.44, bcRR = 1.17; RR = 1.16, bcRR = 1.18; RR = 1.25, bcRR = 1.05; and RR = 0.99, bcRR = 1.18. Conclusions Bias analysis suggests that the previously reported association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and an increased risk of ADHD in the offspring may be due to unmeasured confounding. Our ability to conclude a causal association is limited.},

	abstract = {The case-crossover design (Maclure, 1991) is widely used in epidemiology and other fields to study causal effects of transient treatments on acute outcomes. However, its validity and causal interpretation have only been justified under informal conditions. Here, we place the design in a formal counterfactual framework for the first time. Doing so helps to clarify its assumptions and interpretation. In particular, when the treatment effect is non-null, we identify a previously unnoticed bias arising from common causes of the outcome at different person-times. We analytically characterize the direction and size of this bias and demonstrate its potential importance with a simulation. We also use our derivation of the limit of the case-crossover estimator to analyze its sensitivity to treatment effect heterogeneity, a violation of one of the informal criteria for validity. The upshot of this work for practitioners is that, while the case-crossover design can be useful for testing the causal null hypothesis in the presence of baseline confounders, extra caution is warranted when using the case-crossover design for point estimation of causal effects.},

	abstract = {Objective
There is some evidence that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with increased risk of infections, and it is unknown whether adjustment disorder is as well. We assessed the association between adjustment disorder and subsequent infections, and assessed additive interaction with sex.
Methods
The study population included a nationwide cohort of all Danish-born residents of Denmark diagnosed with adjustment disorder between 1995 and 2011, and an age- and sex-matched general population comparison cohort. We compared rates of infections requiring inpatient or outpatient hospitalization in the two cohorts. We fit Cox proportional hazards models to compute adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) for the associations between adjustment disorder and 32 types of infections, and calculated interaction contrasts to assess interaction between adjustment disorder and sex.
Results
Adjustment disorder was associated with increased rates of infections overall (n = 19,838 infections, aHR = 1.8, 95\% confidence interval = 1.8. 1.9), and increased rates of each individual infection type (aHRs for 30 infections ranged from 1.5 to 2.3), adjusting for baseline psychiatric and somatic comorbidities and marital status. For many infection types (e.g., skin infections, pneumonia), interaction contrasts indicated rate differences were greater among men than women, while for two (urinary tract infections and sexually transmitted infections), rate differences were greater for women.
Conclusions
These findings are consistent with studies examining the relationship between psychological stress and infections, and between PTSD and infections. They may be explained by a combination of the triggering of unhealthy behaviors as well as immune responses to stress.},

Children (52,680; including 5441 siblings) followed up to age 7 were included. We examined differences in exposures and behavioral problems between siblings and non-siblings and by birth order and birth year. We estimated associations between cell phone exposures and behavioral problems while accounting for the random family effect among siblings. The association of behavioral problems with both prenatal and postnatal exposure differed between siblings (odds ratio (OR): 1.07; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.69–1.66) and non-siblings (OR: 1.54; 95\% CI: 1.36–1.74) and within siblings by birth order; the association was strongest for first-born siblings (OR: 1.72; 95\% CI: 0.86–3.42) and negative for later-born siblings (OR: 0.63; 95\% CI: 0.31–1.25), which may be because of increases in cell phone use with later birth year. Sibling analysis can be a powerful tool for (partially) accounting for confounding by invariant unmeasured within-family factors, but it cannot account for uncontrolled confounding by varying family-level factors, such as those that vary with time and birth order.},

It is likely that part of the neighbourhood effects observed for adults, are actually lingering effects of the family in which someone grew up. This study uses a sibling design to disentangle family and neighbourhood effects on income, with contextual sibling pairs used as a control group. The sibling design helps us to separate the effects of childhood family and neighbourhood context from adult neighbourhood experiences. Using data from Swedish population registers, including the full Swedish population, we show that the neighbourhood effect on income from both childhood and adult neighbourhood experiences, is biased upwards by the influence of the childhood family context. Ultimately, we conclude that there is a neighbourhood effect on income from adult neighbourhood experiences, but that the childhood neighbourhood effect is actually a childhood family context effect. We find that there is a long lasting effect of the family context on income later in life, and that this effect is strong regardless the individual neighbourhood pathway later in life.},

We here address this issue in commonly encountered types of sibling studies, allowing for continuous and binary outcomes and varying numbers of exposed and unexposed siblings. For continuous outcomes, we show that in families with sibling pairs, optimal study power is obtained by recruiting discordant (exposed–control) pairs of siblings. More generally, balancing the exposure status within each family as evenly as possible is shown to be optimal. For binary outcomes, we elucidate how the optimal strategy depends on the variation of the binary response; as the within-family correlation increases, the optimal strategy tends toward only recruiting discordant sibling pairs (as in the case of continuous outcomes). R code for obtaining the optimal strategies is included.},

	abstract = {Immortal time bias (ITB) is still seen frequently in medical literature. However, not much is known about this bias in the field of cancer (pharmaco-)epidemiology. In context of a hypothetical beneficial beta-blocker use among cancer patients, we aimed to demonstrate the magnitude of ITB among 9876 prostate, colorectal, lung and pancreatic cancer patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2011, which were selected from a database linkage of the Netherlands Cancer Registry and the PHARMO Database Network. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals from three ITB scenarios, defining exposure at a defined point after diagnosis (model 1), at any point after diagnosis (model 2) and as multiple exposures after diagnosis (model 3), were calculated to investigate the association between beta-blockers and cancer prognosis using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results were compared to unbiased estimates derived from the Mantel–Byar model. Ignoring ITB led to substantial smaller HRs for beta-blocker use proposing a significant protective association in all cancer types [e.g. HR 0.18 (0.07–0.43) for pancreatic cancer in model 1], whereas estimates derived from the Mantel–Byar model were mainly suggesting no association [e.g. HR 1.10 (0.84–1.44)]. The magnitude of bias was consistently larger among cancer types with worse prognosis [overall median HR differences between all scenarios in model 1 and Mantel–Byar model of 0.56 (prostate), 0.72 (colorectal), 0.77 (lung) and 0.85 (pancreas)]. In conclusion, ITB led to spurious beneficial associations of beta-blocker use among cancer patients. The magnitude of ITB depends on the duration of excluded immortal time and the prognosis of each cancer.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To estimate associations between use of β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and breast cancer recurrence in a large Danish cohort.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 18,733 women diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer between 1996 and 2003. Patient, treatment, and 10-year recurrence data were ascertained from the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group registry. Prescription and medical histories were ascertained by linkage to the National Prescription Registry and Registry of Patients, respectively. β-Blocker exposure was defined in aggregate and according to solubility, receptor selectivity, and individual drugs. ACE inhibitor and ARB exposures were defined in aggregate. Recurrence associations were estimated with multivariable Cox regression models in which time-varying drug exposures were lagged by 1 year.
RESULTS: Compared with never users, users of any β-blocker had a lower recurrence hazard in unadjusted models (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.91; 95\% CI, 0.81 to 1.0) and a slightly higher recurrence hazard in adjusted models (adjusted HR = 1.3; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 1.5). Associations were similar for exposures defined by receptor selectivity and solubility. Although most individual β-blockers showed no association with recurrence, metoprolol and sotalol were associated with increased recurrence rates (adjusted metoprolol HR = 1.5, 95\% CI, 1.2 to 1.8; adjusted sotalol HR = 2.0, 95\% CI, 0.99 to 4.0). ACE inhibitors were associated with a slightly increased recurrence hazard, whereas ARBs were not associated with recurrence (adjusted ACE inhibitor HR = 1.2, 95\% CI, 0.97 to 1.4; adjusted ARBs HR = 1.1, 95\% CI, 0.85 to 1.3).
CONCLUSION: Our data do not support the hypothesis that β-blockers attenuate breast cancer recurrence risk.},

Resected patients had better survival than nonresected, irrespective of the type or whether full-dose NAT was given. For all preoperative values of Ca 19-9, surgical resection had positive impact on survival.
OBJECTIVE: Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) has become part of the multimodality treatment for borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) and locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC).
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: It is currently uncertain which are the preferable NAT regimens, who benefits from surgery, and whether more aggressive surgical strategy is motivated.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was performed for all patients with BRPC/LAPC discussed and planned for NAT at multidisciplinary conference at Karolinska University Hospital from 2010 to 2017.
RESULTS: Of 233 patients eligible, 168 (72\%) received NAT and were reevaluated for possibility of resection. A total of 156 (67\%) patients (mean 64 yrs, 53\% male) had pancreatic adenocarcinoma, comprising the study group for survival analysis. LAPC was diagnosed in 132 patients (85\%), BRPC in 22 (14\%), and resectable tumor in 2 (1.3\%). Fifty patients (40.3\%) received full-dose NAT. Only 54 (34.6\%) had FOLFIRINOX. The overall survival among resected patients was similar for BRPC and LAPC (median survival 15.0 vs 14.5 mo, P = 0.4; and 31.9 vs 21.8 mo, P = 0.7, respectively). Resected patients had better survival than nonresected, irrespective of the type or whether full-dose NAT was given (median survival 22.4 vs 12.7 mo; 1-, 3-, and 5-yr survival: 86.4\%, 38.9\%, 26.9\% vs 52.2\%, 1.5\%, 0\%, respectively (P {\textless} 0001). For all preoperative values of Ca 19-9, surgical resection had positive impact on survival.
CONCLUSIONS: All patients with BRPC/LAPC who do not progress during NAT should be considered for surgical resection, irrespective of the type or dose of NAT given. Higher levels of Ca 19-9 should not be considered an absolute contraindication for resection.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: When comparing mammography-screening participants and non-participants, estimates of reduction in breast-cancer mortality may be biased by poor baseline comparability. We used negative controls to detect uncontrolled confounding.
METHODS: We designed a closed cohort of Danish women invited to a mammography-screening programme at age 50-52 years in Copenhagen or Funen from 1991 through 2001. We included women with a normal screening result in their first-invitation round. Based on their second-invitation round, women were divided into participants and non-participants and followed until death, emigration or 31 December 2014, whichever came first. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of death from breast cancer, causes other than breast cancer and external causes. We added dental-care participation as an exposure to test for an independent association with breast-cancer mortality. We adjusted for civil status, parity, age at first birth, educational attainment, income and hormone use.
RESULTS: Screening participants had a lower hazard of breast-cancer death [HR 0.47, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.32, 0.69] compared with non-participants. Participants also had a lower hazard of death from other causes (HR 0.43, 95\% CI 0.39, 0.46) and external causes (HR 0.35, 95\% CI 0.23, 0.54). Reductions persisted after covariate adjustment. Dental-care participants had a lower hazard of breast-cancer death (HR 0.75, 95\% CI 0.56, 1.01), irrespective of screening participation.
CONCLUSIONS: Negative-control associations indicated residual uncontrolled confounding when comparing breast-cancer mortality among screening participants and non-participants.},

In settings where considerable uncertainty surrounds the data or the causal mechanisms underlying the treatment assignment and outcome process, we suggest that researchers report a panel of results under various specifications of statistical models.

	abstract = {Purpose of review:
Pharmacoepidemiologic studies employing large databases are critical
to evaluating the effectiveness and safety of drug exposures in large and
diverse populations. Because treatment is not randomized, researchers must
select a relevant comparison group for the treatment of interest. The
comparator group can consist of individuals initiating: (1) a similarly
indicated treatment (active comparator), (2) a treatment used for a
different indication (inactive comparator) or (3) no particular treatment
(non-initiators). Herein we review recent literature and describe
considerations and implications of comparator selection in
pharmacoepidemiologic studies.

Recent findings:
Comparator selection depends on the scientific question and
feasibility constraints. Because pharmacoepidemiologic studies rely on the
choice to initiate or not initiate a specific treatment, rather than
randomization, they are at-risk for confounding related to the comparator
choice including: by indication, disease severity and frailty. We describe
forms of confounding specific to pharmacoepidemiologic studies and discuss
each comparator along with informative examples and a case study. We provide
commentary on potential issues relevant to comparator selection in each
study, highlighting the importance of understanding the population in whom
the treatment is given and how patient characteristics are associated with
the outcome.

Summary:
Advanced statistical techniques may be insufficient for reducing
confounding in observational studies. Evaluating the extent to which
comparator selection may mitigate or induce systematic bias is a critical
component of pharmacoepidemiologic studies.},

	abstract = {Background
The cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitor rofecoxib was recently withdrawn because of cardiovascular adverse effects. An increased risk of myocardial infarction had been observed in 2000 in the Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research study (VIGOR), but was attributed to cardioprotection of naproxen rather than a cardiotoxic effect of rofecoxib. We used standard and cumulative random-effects meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials and observational studies to establish whether robust evidence on the adverse effects of rofecoxib was available before September, 2004.
Methods
We searched bibliographic databases and relevant files of the US Food and Drug Administration. We included all randomised controlled trials in patients with chronic musculoskeletal disorders that compared rofecoxib with other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or placebo, and cohort and case-control studies of cardiovascular risk and naproxen. Myocardial infarction was the primary endpoint.
Findings
We identified 18 randomised controlled trials and 11 observational studies. By the end of 2000 (52 myocardial infarctions, 20742 patients) the relative risk from randomised controlled trials was 2·30 (95\% CI 1·22–4·33, p=0·010), and 1 year later (64 events, 21432 patients) it was 2·24 (1·24–4·02, p=0·007). There was little evidence that the relative risk differed depending on the control group (placebo, non-naproxen NSAID, or naproxen; p=0·41) or trial duration (p=0·82). In observational studies, the cardioprotective effect of naproxen was small (combined estimate 0·86 [95\% CI 0·75–0·99]) and could not have explained the findings of the VIGOR trial.
Interpretation
Our findings indicate that rofecoxib should have been withdrawn several years earlier. The reasons why manufacturer and drug licensing authorities did not continuously monitor and summarise the accumulating evidence need to be clarified.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) may be associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events, but only limited long-term data have been available for analysis. We report on the cardiovascular outcomes associated with the use of the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib in a long-term, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial designed to determine the effect of three years of treatment with rofecoxib on the risk of recurrent neoplastic polyps of the large bowel in patients with a history of colorectal adenomas.
METHODS: A total of 2586 patients with a history of colorectal adenomas underwent randomization: 1287 were assigned to receive 25 mg of rofecoxib daily, and 1299 to receive placebo. All investigator-reported serious adverse events that represented potential thrombotic cardiovascular events were adjudicated in a blinded fashion by an external committee.
RESULTS: A total of 46 patients in the rofecoxib group had a confirmed thrombotic event during 3059 patient-years of follow-up (1.50 events per 100 patient-years), as compared with 26 patients in the placebo group during 3327 patient-years of follow-up (0.78 event per 100 patient-years); the corresponding relative risk was 1.92 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.19 to 3.11; P=0.008). The increased relative risk became apparent after 18 months of treatment; during the first 18 months, the event rates were similar in the two groups. The results primarily reflect a greater number of myocardial infarctions and ischemic cerebrovascular events in the rofecoxib group. There was earlier separation (at approximately five months) between groups in the incidence of nonadjudicated investigator-reported congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, or cardiac failure (hazard ratio for the comparison of the rofecoxib group with the placebo group, 4.61; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.50 to 18.83). Overall and cardiovascular mortality was similar in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with a history of colorectal adenomas, the use of rofecoxib was associated with an increased cardiovascular risk.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the risk of serious upper gastrointestinal bleeding associated with the newer antithrombotic agents used alone or in combination with other antithrombotic drugs; to describe the trends in use of antithrombotic drugs in the background population.
DESIGN: Population based case-control study.
SETTING: Funen County, Denmark (population 470,000).
SUBJECTS: 1443 cases of serious upper gastrointestinal bleeding identified during 2000-4; 57,720 age and sex matched controls.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Exposure to low dose aspirin, clopidogrel, dipyridamole, vitamin K antagonists, and combined antithrombotic treatment.
RESULTS: Adjusted odds ratios associating drug use with upper gastrointestinal bleeding were 1.8 (95\% confidence interval 1.5 to 2.1) for low dose aspirin, 1.1 (0.6 to 2.1) for clopidogrel, 1.9 (1.3 to 2.8) for dipyridamole, and 1.8 (1.3 to 2.4) for vitamin K antagonists. Corresponding figures for combined use were 7.4 (3.5 to 15) for clopidogrel and aspirin, 5.3 (2.9 to 9.5) for vitamin K antagonists and aspirin, and 2.3 (1.7 to 3.3) for dipyridamole and aspirin. Other combinations were used too infrequently to allow estimation. The number of treatment years needed to produce one excess case varied from 124 for the clopidogrel-aspirin combination to 8800 for clopidogrel alone. During the study period, exposure to combined antithrombotic regimens increased by 425\% in the background population.
CONCLUSION: Antithrombotic treatment is becoming increasingly aggressive. Combined antithrombotic treatment confers particular risk and is associated with high incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding.},

	abstract = {Background: Myriad reports suggest that frequently used prescription drugs alter the viability of breast cancer cells in pre-clinical studies. Routine use of these drugs, therefore, may impact breast cancer prognosis, and could have important implications for public health.Methods: The Danish Breast Cancer Group (DBCG) clinical database provides high-quality prospectively collected data on breast cancer diagnosis, treatment, and routine follow-up for breast cancer recurrence. Individual-level linkage of DBCG data to other population-based and medical registries in Denmark, including the Danish National Prescription Registry, has facilitated large population-based pharmacoepidemiology studies. A unique advantage of using DBCG data for such studies is the ability to investigate the association of drugs with breast cancer recurrence rather than breast cancer mortality – which may be misclassified – or all-cause mortality. Here we summarize findings from pharmacoepidemiological studies, based on DBCG data, on the association between routinely used prescription drugs and risk of breast cancer recurrence.Results: Our findings suggest that concurrent use of glucocorticoids, ACE inhibitors, aspirin, NSAIDs, selective COX-2 inhibitors, digoxin, and opioids has little impact on breast cancer recurrence. Similarly, patients who use SSRIs concurrently with tamoxifen treatment are not at increased risk of recurrence. In contrast, post-diagnostic use of simvastatin, a lipophilic statin, correlates with a decreased risk of breast cancer recurrence, providing a rationale for a prospective randomized clinical trial investigating simvastatin as an adjuvant therapy for breast cancer.Conclusion: As a whole, findings of pharmacoepidemiological studies based on DBCG data provide reassurance to physicians and healthcare personnel who provide supportive care during and after cancer (including prescriptions for comedications) and to breast cancer survivors for whom the risk of breast cancer recurrence is a major concern.},

	abstract = {Comorbid diseases can affect breast cancer prognosis. We conducted a population-based study of Danish women diagnosed with a first primary breast cancer from 1995 to 2005 (n=9300), using hospital discharge registry data to quantify comorbidities by Charlson score. We examined the influence of comorbidities on survival, and quantified their impact on relative mortality rates. The prevalence of patients with a Charlson score=‘0' fell from 86 to 81\%, with an increase in those with Charlson score=‘1–2' from 13 to 16\%, and score=‘3+' from 1 to 2\%. One- and five-year survival for patients with Charlson score=‘0' and ‘1–2' was better for those diagnosed in 1998–2000 than in 1995–1997. Overall, patients diagnosed in 2001–2004 (mortality ratio (MR)=0.80, 95\% CI=0.68–0.95) and 1998–2000 (MR=0.92, 95\% CI=0.78–1.09) had lower 1-year age-adjusted mortality compared to those diagnosed in 1995–1997 (reference period). Patients with Charlson scores ‘1–2' and ‘3+' had higher age-adjusted 1-year mortality than those with a Charlson score=‘0' in each time period (2001–2004: MR‘1–2'=1.76, 95\% CI=1.35–2.30, and MR‘3+'=3.78, 95\% CI=2.51–5.68; and 1998–2000: MR‘1–2'=1.60, 95\% CI=1.36–1.88 and MR‘3+'=2.34, 95\% CI=1.65–3.33). Similar findings were observed for 5-year age-adjusted mortality. Additional analyses, adjusted for stage, indicated that confounding by stage could not explain these findings. Despite continued improvements in breast cancer survival, we found a trend of poorer survival among breast cancer patients with severe comorbidities even after adjusting for age and stage. Such poorer survival is an important public health concern and can be expected to worsen as the population ages.},

However, little effort has been given to explore the risk and potential impact of selection bias in studies of pubertal timing. Objective We aimed to explore the risk of selection bias due to non-participation in a newly established puberty cohort. Methods We evaluated whether three maternal exposures chosen a priori (pre-pregnancy obesity, smoking, and alcohol drinking during pregnancy) were associated with participation, whether pubertal timing was associated with participation, and whether selection bias influenced the associations between these exposures and pubertal timing. In total, 22 439 children from the Danish National Birth Cohort born 2000–2003 were invited to the Puberty Cohort and 15 819 (70\%) participated. Exposures were self-reported during pregnancy. Pubertal timing was measured using a previously validated marker, “the height difference in standard deviations” (HD:SDS), which is the difference between pubertal height and adult height, both in standard deviations. For this study, pubertal height at around 13 years in sons and around 11 years in daughters was obtained from an external database, and adult height was predicted based on parental height reported by mothers. Results Participation was associated with most exposures but not with pubertal timing, measured by HD:SDS. The associations between exposures and HD:SDS were comparable for participants only and all invited for participation. Conclusion In conclusion, the risk of selection bias in aetiologic studies on pubertal timing in the Puberty Cohort appears minimal.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Beryllium is classified as carcinogenic on the basis largely of limited human data showing a modest increase in lung cancer from occupational exposure. With occupational exposure now curtailed, earlier results merit more scrutiny. We simulated data to understand the design implications of a landmark case-control study.
Methods
We generated datasets from the original occupational cohort by randomly assigning lung cancer events to workers independently of their exposure. We analyzed the simulated data on the basis of different modes of risk-set sampling, with risk sets defined by calendar time, age, or both, to assess how much bias existed using several exposure metrics. We controlled for several time related variables to assess confounding. Finally, we re-analyzed the data from the original study, controlling for time-related covariates.
Results
No bias occurred using any type of risk-set sampling with unlagged exposures. When exposure was lagged 10 or 20 years, however, there was considerable confounding by year of birth and year of hire, which remained uncontrolled in the original study.
Conclusions
Simulations and reanalysis show that much of the reported association with lagged exposure is attributable to confounding by year of birth and year of hire. Lagging changes the exposure variable and can thus lead to changes in the amount of confounding.},

The results for hazard ratios are derived under a proportional hazard assumption for the exposure. For outcome probabilities specified to lie in symmetric intervals centered around 0.5, it is shown that the square-root transformation of the odds ratio is the optimal minimax conversion for the risk ratio. General results for any nonsymmetric interval are given both for odds ratio and for hazard ratio conversions. The results are principally useful when odds ratios or hazard ratios are reported in papers, and the reader does not have access to the data or to information about the overall outcome prevalence.},

	doi = {10.1016/S0140-6736(19)32316-5},
	abstract = {Background
Systematic reviews have consistently shown that individuals with mental disorders have an increased risk of premature mortality. Traditionally, this evidence has been based on relative risks or crude estimates of reduced life expectancy. The aim of this study was to compile a comprehensive analysis of mortality-related health metrics associated with mental disorders, including sex-specific and age-specific mortality rate ratios (MRRs) and life-years lost (LYLs), a measure that takes into account age of onset of the disorder.
Methods
In this population-based cohort study, we included all people younger than 95 years of age who lived in Denmark at some point between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2015. Information on mental disorders was obtained from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register and the date and cause of death was obtained from the Danish Register of Causes of Death. We classified mental disorders into ten groups and causes of death into 11 groups, which were further categorised into natural causes (deaths from diseases and medical conditions) and external causes (suicide, homicide, and accidents). For each specific mental disorder, we estimated MRRs using Poisson regression models, adjusting for sex, age, and calendar time, and excess LYLs (ie, difference in LYLs between people with a mental disorder and the general population) for all-cause mortality and for each specific cause of death.
Findings
7 369 926 people were included in our analysis. We found that mortality rates were higher for people with a diagnosis of a mental disorder than for the general Danish population (28·70 deaths [95\% CI 28·57–28·82] vs 12·95 deaths [12·93–12·98] per 1000 person-years). Additionally, all types of disorders were associated with higher mortality rates, with MRRs ranging from 1·92 (95\% CI 1·91–1·94) for mood disorders to 3·91 (3·87–3·94) for substance use disorders. All types of mental disorders were associated with shorter life expectancies, with excess LYLs ranging from 5·42 years (95\% CI 5·36–5·48) for organic disorders in females to 14·84 years (14·70–14·99) for substance use disorders in males. When we examined specific causes of death, we found that males with any type of mental disorder lost fewer years due to neoplasm-related deaths compared with the general population, although their cancer mortality rates were higher.
Interpretation
Mental disorders are associated with premature mortality. We provide a comprehensive analysis of mortality by different types of disorders, presenting both MRRs and premature mortality based on LYLs, displayed by age, sex, and cause of death. By providing accurate estimates of premature mortality, we reveal previously underappreciated features related to competing risks and specific causes of death.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite a prevailing assumption that adult ADHD is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder, no prospective longitudinal study has described the childhoods of the adult ADHD population. The authors report follow-back analyses of ADHD cases diagnosed in adulthood, alongside follow-forward analyses of ADHD cases diagnosed in childhood, in one cohort.
METHOD: Participants belonged to a representative birth cohort of 1,037 individuals born in Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1972 and 1973 and followed to age 38, with 95\% retention. Symptoms of ADHD, associated clinical features, comorbid disorders, neuropsychological deficits, genome-wide association study-derived polygenic risk, and life impairment indicators were assessed. Data sources were participants, parents, teachers, informants, neuropsychological test results, and administrative records. Adult ADHD diagnoses used DSM-5 criteria, apart from onset age and cross-setting corroboration, which were study outcome measures.
RESULTS: As expected, childhood ADHD had a prevalence of 6\% (predominantly male) and was associated with childhood comorbid disorders, neurocognitive deficits, polygenic risk, and residual adult life impairment. Also as expected, adult ADHD had a prevalence of 3\% (gender balanced) and was associated with adult substance dependence, adult life impairment, and treatment contact. Unexpectedly, the childhood ADHD and adult ADHD groups comprised virtually nonoverlapping sets; 90\% of adult ADHD cases lacked a history of childhood ADHD. Also unexpectedly, the adult ADHD group did not show tested neuropsychological deficits in childhood or adulthood, nor did they show polygenic risk for childhood ADHD.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings raise the possibility that adults presenting with the ADHD symptom picture may not have a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder. If this finding is replicated, then the disorder's place in the classification system must be reconsidered, and research must investigate the etiology of adult ADHD.},

	abstract = {Causal effect identiﬁcation is one of the most prominent and well-understood problems in causal inference. Despite the generality and power of the results developed so far, there are still challenges in their applicability to practical settings, arguably due to the ﬁnitude of the samples. Simply put, there is a gap between causal effect identiﬁcation and estimation. One popular setting in which sample-efﬁcient estimators from ﬁnite samples exist is when the celebrated back-door condition holds. In this paper, we extend weighting-based methods developed for the back-door case to more general settings, and develop novel machinery for estimating causal effects using the weighting-based method as a building block. We derive graphical criteria under which causal effects can be estimated using this new machinery and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through simulation studies.},

	abstract = {Background: In Denmark, the incidence of breast cancer is higher among women with higher socioeconomic position. We investigated whether differences in exposure to certain risk factors contribute to this gradient, as measured from education, income and occupation. Methods: We conducted a cohort study of 23111 postmenopausal women aged 50–65 years who were enrolled in the prospective Danish ‘Diet, Cancer and Health’ study between 1993 and 1995. At baseline, all women filled in a questionnaire on lifestyle and food frequency. The results were analysed in Cox proportional hazard models. Results: Part of the association with socioeconomic position is due to the potential mediators reproductive pattern, use of hormone replacement therapy and alcohol consumption. After simultaneous adjustment for these factors, the hazard ratios were 1.06 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.88–1.27) for women with higher education and 1.07 (95\% CI, 0.85–1.34) for women with higher income. The HR ratio for women working as higher officials when compared with unskilled workers was 1.23 (0.96–1.59). Conclusion: The results support the hypothesis that the higher incidence of breast cancer among socially advantaged women is mediated partly by differences in exposure to reproductive factors, hormone replacement therapy and alcohol.},

This study aimed to unravel clues to the development in colon cancer incidence by investigating changes over time in incidence by socio-economic group. Methods: Persons participating in the 1970 censuses in Norway and Denmark were aged 55?75 years in 1971?1980 (called pre-crossing period) and in 1991?2000 (called post-crossing period), respectively. Country, sex, age and socio-economic group-specific colon cancer incidence rates. Percent change in the average rate from the pre- to the post-crossing period. Results: In the pre-crossing period, Norwegian male managers/administrators had the highest colon cancer incidence, but the largest increase in incidence from the pre-to the post-crossing period was seen for unskilled workers, skilled workers and farmers. The rate for unskilled workers almost doubled and in the post-crossing period this rate had bypassed that of managers/administrators. A similar development was seen for Norwegian women and was less dramatic in Denmark. Conclusions: The change in the risk of manual workers has been the driving force behind the dramatic increase in the Norwegian incidence of colon cancer. This development resulted in a reversal of the socio-economic gradient from the classic European pattern with the highest incidence in the upper socio-economic groups to an American pattern with the highest incidence in the lower socio-economic groups. This ?Americanization? of the disease pattern followed the rapid growth in the Norwegian gross domestic product.},

METHODS: Data from population-based cancer registries in 12 jurisdictions in six countries were provided for 2·4 million adults diagnosed with primary colorectal, lung, breast (women), or ovarian cancer during 1995-2007, with follow-up to Dec 31, 2007. Data quality control and analyses were done centrally with a common protocol, overseen by external experts. We estimated 1-year and 5-year relative survival, constructing 252 complete life tables to control for background mortality by age, sex, and calendar year. We report age-specific and age-standardised relative survival at 1 and 5 years, and 5-year survival conditional on survival to the first anniversary of diagnosis. We also examined incidence and mortality trends during 1985-2005.
FINDINGS: Relative survival improved during 1995-2007 for all four cancers in all jurisdictions. Survival was persistently higher in Australia, Canada, and Sweden, intermediate in Norway, and lower in Denmark, England, Northern Ireland, and Wales, particularly in the first year after diagnosis and for patients aged 65 years and older. International differences narrowed at all ages for breast cancer, from about 9\% to 5\% at 1 year and from about 14\% to 8\% at 5 years, but less or not at all for the other cancers. For colorectal cancer, the international range narrowed only for patients aged 65 years and older, by 2-6\% at 1 year and by 2-3\% at 5 years.
INTERPRETATION: Up-to-date survival trends show increases but persistent differences between countries. Trends in cancer incidence and mortality are broadly consistent with these trends in survival. Data quality and changes in classification are not likely explanations. The patterns are consistent with later diagnosis or differences in treatment, particularly in Denmark and the UK, and in patients aged 65 years and older.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women and the incidence has increased over time. Our objectives were to study: (1) the socioeconomic differences in breast cancer incidence and mortality in Denmark, (2) how different socioeconomic groups have contributed to the increasing incidence, (3) whether the diverging trend between breast cancer incidence and mortality reflects different socioeconomic distributions of breast cancer cases and breast cancer deaths, and (4) to compare measures of socioeconomic status based on own and spouses' occupation, respectively. We addressed these questions by studying the socioeconomic distribution of breast cancer incidence and breast cancer mortality in Danish women during the last 25 years.
METHODS: In all 1 402 225 women in Denmark were individually followed up for death, emigration, and incident breast cancer in 1970-1995. Of the 1 402 225 women included in the study, 730 549 were economically active in 1970, and 480 379 women were both married and economically active. Socioeconomic status was assessed based on the occupation in 1970.
RESULTS: For all women classified by their own socioeconomic group, the standardized incidence (SIR) and the standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were highest in academics (SIR = 1.39, SMR = 1.29), and lowest in women in agriculture (SIR = 0.77, SMR = 0.75). For married, economically active women classified by their own socioeconomic group the SIR and SMR were highest in academics (SIR = 1.40, SMR = 1.44) and lowest in women in agriculture (SIR = 0.76, SMR = 0.76). Classified by their husbands' socioeconomic group, the SIR and SMR were highest in women married to academics (SIR = 1.21, SMR = 1.16) and lowest in women married to men in agriculture (SIR = 0.79, SMR = 0.79). From 1970 to 1995, the risk of developing breast cancer increased by 38\% in women aged 50-64. All social groups contributed to this increase, the increase being 45\% in unskilled workers, and 26\% in academics.
CONCLUSION: During the last quarter of the 20th century academics had the highest risk of breast cancer in Denmark. The size of the social gradient in breast cancer occurrence depended on the measure used. The time trends in social distribution will result in breast cancer becoming more frequent.},

Cox proportional hazards models were used. Males and females classified as obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg /m−2) have a 33\% and 22\% increased risk of all-cancer, respectively, than their normal weight counterparts. Similar all-cancer risk increases are observed for those above sex-specific WC guidelines. Mutual adjustment for WC attenuates the association between BMI and all-cancer risk, especially among females. Central adiposity appears to be a stronger predictor of all-cancer risk than body size.},

Monitoring the prevalence of cancer risk factors and preventive tests helps guide cancer prevention and early detection efforts. We provide an updated review, using data through 2015, of the prevalence of major risk factors, cancer screening, and vaccination for U.S. adults and youth. Cigarette smoking among adults decreased to 15.3\% in 2015 but remains higher among lower socioeconomic persons (GED: 34.1\%, graduate degree: 3.7\%), with considerable state variation (Utah: 9.1\%, Kentucky: 26.0\%). The prevalence of obesity among both adults (37.7\%) and adolescents (20.6\%) remains high, particularly among black women (57.2\%), and ranges from 20.2\% (Colorado) to 36.2\% (Louisiana) among adults. Pap testing remains the most commonly utilized cancer screening test (81.4\%). While colorectal cancer screening has increased, only 62.6\% are up-to-date with recommendations. Cancer screening is lowest among the uninsured and varies across states. Despite some improvements, systematic efforts to further reduce the suffering and death from cancer should be enhanced.

Factors analyzed in patients 40 years of age or younger (group A) as compared with those 41 years of age or older (group B) include the following: obesity 43.8\% (A) versus 17.9\% (B), nulliparity 44\% (A) versus 10.5\% (B), hypertension 31.2\% (A) versus 42.1\% (B), and diabetes 6.2\% (A) versus 21.1\% (B). Patients in group A tended to have a well-differentiated tumor, and 31.2\% had polycystic ovaries. Awareness of risk factors in young women who develop endometrial adenocarcinoma leads to earlier diagnosis and will preserve the historically excellent survival rate of young women.

Disparities between developed and developing countries are highlighted for maternal mortality, infant mortality, stillbirth and low birth weight. The higher rate of low birth weight in developing countries is primarily due to intrauterine growth restriction rather than preterm birth. Much of the excess intrauterine growth restriction is caused by short maternal stature, low prepregnancy body mass index and low gestational weight gain (due to low energy intake). No important contribution has been established for micronutrient intake, nor have different fetal growth trajectories been demonstrated to reﬂect the timing of exposure to nutritional or other etiologic factors. Infant mortality has declined substantially over time both in developed and developing countries despite no decline (and even an increase) in low birth weight. Several developed countries have reported a temporal increase in fetal growth in infants born at term, a reduction in stillbirth rates and prevention of neural tube defects. More progress is required, however, in understanding the etiology and prevention of preterm birth. J. Nutr. 133: 1592S–1596S, 2003.},

	abstract = {Objective: To assess trends and outcomes of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) in New South Wales (NSW). Methods: A population-based descriptive study of all 52,151 women who had a PPH either during the hospital stay for the birth of their baby or requiring a re-admission to hospital between 1994 and 2002. Data were obtained from the de-identified computerised census of NSW hospital in-patients and analysed to examine trends over time. The outcome measures included maternal death, hysterectomy, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), transfusion and major maternal morbidity, including procedures to reduce blood supply to the uterus, acute renal failure and postpartum coaqulation defects. Results: From 1994 to 2002 both the number and adjusted (for under-reporting) rate of PPH during the birth admission increased from 8.3\% of deliveries to 10.7\%. The rate of PPH adjusted for maternal age and mode of delivery was similar to the unadjusted rate. There was a sixfold increase in the rate of transfusions from 1.9\% of women who haemorrhaged to 11.7\%. Hospital readmissions for PPH declined from 1.2\% of deliveries to 0.9\%. These were statistically significant changes. There were no significant changes in the rate of hysterectomies, procedures to reduce blood supply to the uterus, admissions to ICU, acute renal failure or coagulation defects. Conclusion: The increased rate of PPH during the birth admission is concerning. The increase in PPH could not be explained by increasing maternal age or caesarean sections. Linked birth and hospital discharge data could determine whether the increase in PPH is caused by other changes in obstetric practices or population.},

@phdthesis{rasmussen_intensive_2018,
	title = {Intensive {Smoking} {Cessation} {Interventions} in {Denmark} - {Based} on data from the {Danish} {Smoking} {Cessation} {Database}},
	abstract = {Background
Tobacco smoking is by far the most deadly and preventable lifestyle factor for public health, both globally and nationally. Nevertheless, it is estimated that worldwide, more than 1.1 billion adults are smokers. Today, 16\% (0.8 million) of the adult population in Denmark are daily smokers, while 23\% (1.1 million) consider themselves smokers, and one in four deaths are smoking related. The most effective method of reducing smoking prevalence is by employing a two-tier strategy to 1) prevent adolescents from initiating smoking and 2) offer effective help to smokers to quit.

The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the effect of intensive smoking cessation interventions (ISCI) on successful quitting through different study designs, synthesised from cohort studies and a review of randomised controlled trials. The aim was fulfilled through 4 scientific studies, each with their own objective.

Studies
A systematic review with meta-analysis (I) was set up to compare ISCI and shorter interventions in randomised controlled trials (RCT). Initially, 9,569 unique papers were identified, and, after screening for relevant studies, 18 RCTs were included, investigating a total of 10,131 smokers. The studies were primarily conducted in Western Europa and the USA. The body of evidence for three of four outcomes were graded moderate, and the last outcome was graded low. A random effect meta-analysis revealed that smokers randomised to ISCI were significantly more likely to be successful quitters compared to shorter interventions for all four outcomes. The primary outcome (continuous abstinence in the short and long term) increased the chance of success 3-fold.

A methodological study (II) of the Danish National Smoking Cessation Database (SCDB) was undertaken. The development of the SCDB and the most commonly registered smoking cessation interventions (SCI) were described, as were the data collection and validity.

Two cohort studies based on the data from the SCDB were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of SCI in real life. One study investigated the effectiveness of five different SCIs (III) and found that the intensive Gold Standard Programme’ (GSP - Standard SCI in Denmark) was the only intervention that was effective for both men and women. The other cohort study was set up to investigate the effectiveness of the GSP in a vulnerable subgroup of smokers diagnosed with severe mental disorder (SMD) (IV). The study showed that smokers with SMD were significantly less likely to become successful quitters compared to smokers without mental disorders. However, one in every four smokers with SMD managed to stay continuously smoke-free for at least 6 months compared to one in three in the comparison group. The data were analysed using a mixed-effect logistic regression model. In both cohort studies, compliance was identified as the strongest predictor of a successful outcome.

Conclusion
This thesis adds to the evidence on intensive smoking cessation interventions (ISCI) through different study designs. The results from both study designs favoured ISCI, although the GSP was significantly less effective in smokers with SMD compared to smokers without mental illness. To develop effective SCI in the future, it is important to evaluate the effects in an RCT and to follow-up the post-implementation effects in real life (e.g., through a national SCDB).},

We examined the prevalence of AED use: the proportion of pregnancies with ≥1 prescription filled from 3 months before pregnancy until birth, and individual patterns of use by trimester. Results Prevalence of AED use in almost five million pregnancies was 15.3 per 1000 (n = 75 249) and varied from 6.4 in Sweden to 34.5 per 1000 in the publicly-insured US population. AED use increased in all countries in 2006-2012 ranging from an increase of 22\% in Australia to 104\% in Sweden, and continued to rise or stabilized in the countries in which more recent data were available. Lamotrigine, clonazepam, and valproate were the most commonly used AEDs in the Nordic countries, United States, and Australia, respectively. Among AED users, 31\% only filled a prescription in the 3 months before pregnancy. Most filled a prescription in the first trimester (59\%) but few filled prescriptions in every trimester (22\%). Conclusions Use of AEDs in pregnancy rose from 2006 to 2016. Trends and patterns of use of valproate and lamotrigine reflected the safety data available during this period. Many women discontinued AEDs during pregnancy while some switched to another AED.},

Methods We retrieved data on antipsychotic use between 2006 and 2016 from Danish, Norwegian and Swedish national prescription registers. For each antipsychotic, we calculated prevalence of use and mean doses, overall and for specific age groups (young, adults and elderly). Results Antipsychotic use in Scandinavia increased from 16.5 to 17.2 users/1000 inhabitants between 2006 and 2016 (+2.4\%, annual change: 0.07 users/1000 inhabitants/year, 95\% CI: 0.02–0.20, P = 0.02). In 2006, chlorprothixene and levomepromazine were the most commonly used antipsychotics. By 2016, quetiapine was the most used antipsychotic in all three countries and across all age groups, with an overall 1-year prevalence of 4.05–9.97 users/1000 inhabitants (annual change: 0.57 users/1000 inhabitants/year, 95\% CI: 0.54–0.60, P {\textless} 0.001). Quetiapine showed a marked decrease in mean doses during the 11-year study period (0.46–0.28 defined daily doses (DDD)/user/day: 39.1\%, −0.02 DDD/user/day/year, 95\% CI: −0.020 to −0.015, P {\textless} 0.001). In 2016, the highest mean doses were seen for clozapine (0.90–1.07 DDD/user/day) and olanzapine (0.66–0.88 DDD/user/day). Conclusions There is an increased prevalence of antipsychotic prescriptions that coincides with low and/or decreasing mean doses of the majority of commonly used antipsychotics in Scandinavia. Of all antipsychotics, this development was most pronounced for quetiapine. Reasons for and consequences of increased antipsychotic use that lasts shorter periods of time requires further study.},

	abstract = {Background
We aimed to describe patterns of use and characteristics of 10 commonly used antidepressants for the period 2009–2014 in Denmark, Germany, Spain, and Sweden.
Methods
Adult initiators from 2009 to 2014 of each study antidepressant were identified in four countries using five data sources: the Danish National registers, GePaRD (Germany), EpiChron (Aragon, Spain), SIDIAP (Catalonia, Spain), and the Swedish National Registers. The study included 10 study antidepressants: citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, amitriptyline, mirtazapine, and agomelatine.
Results
Citalopram was the most prescribed study antidepressant, followed by mirtazapine. Paroxetine and agomelatine were the least prescribed antidepressants. Mirtazapine was widely used among older antidepressant initiators with higher percentages of comorbidities at baseline, and fluoxetine was used among young patients. Citalopram and amitriptyline had the lowest percentage of multiple antidepressant use in the 12 months prior to the current treatment episode, while agomelatine, duloxetine, and venlafaxine had the highest percentage of multiple antidepressant use in the year prior to the current treatment episode.
Limitations
The most important limitations are exposure information based on filled prescriptions, focus on antidepressant initiators only, lack of information on the indication, and heterogeneity of the type of data across data sources.
Conclusions
Results of this study including 4.8 million study antidepressant initiators of study antidepressants suggest that citalopram and mirtazapine are the most commonly prescribed antidepressants. Agomelatine and paroxetine were the least used antidepressants in the participating populations. Mirtazapine was the antidepressant most commonly prescribed among older antidepressant initiators with high percentage of comorbidities at baseline, whereas fluoxetine was commonly used among young patients.},

Our review examined the time trends for mental health problems in these countries between 1990 and 2010.
CONCLUSION: In general, there were only small changes in mental health problems in the countries studied. However, we did note a marked rising trend in mental health problems among adolescents in Sweden, which also has more issues with school achievement and unemployment rates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose was to describe utilization of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), including trends in prevalence, characteristics of users, drug switching and changes in prescribed doses in a large group of pregnant women across four Nordic countries.
METHODS: A drug utilization study based on linked individual-level data from the nationwide prescription- and medical birth registers in Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. The study population comprised all pregnancies in these countries, resulting in a live birth or stillbirth after gestational week 22 from January 1st 2008 to December 31st 2012 (N = 1 162 470). In addition to the main study drugs SSRIs and SNRIs, we included (concurrent) use of other antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics and hypnotics.
RESULTS: A total of 38 219 (3.3\%) pregnancies were exposed to SSRIs and 5 634 (0.5\%) to SNRIs. Prevalence of SSRI and SNRI use varied by country (1.8\% in Norway to 7.0\% in Iceland). Use and prescribed dosages decreased with each passing trimester of pregnancy; prevalence was 2.7\% at conception, and 2.1\%, 1.7\% and 1.3\% respectively in 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester. In 0.6\% of pregnancies women filled a prescription before pregnancy and in every trimester. In one third of exposed pregnancies, women were also dispensed anxiolytics, hypnotics or sedatives.
CONCLUSION: Use of SSRI and SNRI use during pregnancy varied between the Nordic countries, but the overall prevalence remained low and relatively stable from 2008 to 2012. The low prevalence of use and high proportion of women who discontinue treatment in pregnancy raise questions about adequate treatment of depression in pregnant women.},

	abstract = {Background.  In generalized epidemic settings, strategies are needed to prioritize individuals at higher risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition for prevention services. We used population-level HIV testing data from rural Kenya and Uganda to construct HIV risk scores and assessed their ability to identify seroconversions.
Methods.  During 2013–2017, {\textgreater}75\% of residents in 16 communities in the SEARCH study were tested annually for HIV. In this population, we evaluated 3 strategies for using demographic factors to predict the 1-year risk of HIV seroconversion: membership in ≥1 known “risk group” (eg, having a spouse living with HIV), a “model-based” risk score constructed with logistic regression, and a “machine learning” risk score constructed with the Super Learner algorithm. We hypothesized machine learning would identify high-risk individuals more efficiently (fewer persons targeted for a fixed sensitivity) and with higher sensitivity (for a fixed number targeted) than either other approach.
Results.  A total of 75 558 persons contributed 166 723 person-years of follow-up; 519 seroconverted. Machine learning improved efficiency. To achieve a fixed sensitivity of 50\%, the risk-group strategy targeted 42\% of the population, the model-based strategy targeted 27\%, and machine learning targeted 18\%. Machine learning also improved sensitivity. With an upper limit of 45\% targeted, the risk-group strategy correctly classified 58\% of seroconversions, the model-based strategy 68\%, and machine learning 78\%.
Conclusions.  Machine learning improved classification of individuals at risk of HIV acquisition compared with a model-based approach or reliance on known risk groups and could inform targeting of prevention strategies in generalized epidemic settings. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT01864603.},

Validation data permit calculation of a bias-adjusted estimate, which has the same expected value as the association that would have been observed had the gold-standard measurement been available for the entire study population. Existing guidance on optimal sampling for validation substudies assumes complete enrollment and follow-up of the target cohort. No guidance exists for validation substudy design while cohort data are actively being collected. In this article, we use the framework of Bayesian monitoring methods to develop an adaptive approach to validation study design. This method monitors whether sufficient validation data have been collected to meet predefined criteria for estimation of the positive and negative predictive values. We demonstrate the utility of this method using the Study of Transition, Outcomes and Gender—a cohort study of transgender and gender nonconforming people. We demonstrate the method’s ability to determine efficacy (when sufficient validation data have accumulated to obtain estimates of the predictive values that fall above a threshold value) and futility (when sufficient validation data have accumulated to conclude the mismeasured variable is an untenable substitute for the gold-standard measurement). This proposed method can be applied within the context of any parent epidemiologic study design and modified to meet alternative criteria given specific study or validation study objectives. Our method provides a novel approach to effective and efficient estimation of classification parameters as validation data accrue.},

	abstract = {When studying the effect of a prenatal treatment on events in the offspring, failure to produce a live birth is a competing event for events in the offspring. A common approach to handle this competing event is reporting both the treatment-specific probabilities of live births and of the event of interest among live births. However, when the treatment affects the competing event, the latter probability cannot be interpreted as the causal effect among live births.
        Here we provide guidance for researchers interested in the effects of prenatal treatments on events in the offspring in the presence of the competing event “no live birth”. We review the total effect of treatment on a composite event and the total effect of treatment on the event of interest. These causal effects are helpful for decision making, but are agnostic about the pathways through which treatment affects the event of interest.
        Therefore, based on recent work, we also review three causal effects that explicitly consider the pathways through which treatment may affect the event of interest in the presence of competing events: the direct effect of treatment on the event of interest under an intervention to eliminate the competing event, the separable direct and indirect effects of treatment on the event of interest, and the effect of treatment in the principal stratum of those who would have had a live birth irrespective of treatment choice. As an illustrative example, we use a randomized trial of fertility treatments and risk of neonatal complications.},

              Background
              Maternal antidepressant use in pregnancy has been associated with both shorter gestational length and child anxiety. We employed paternal antidepressant use as a negative-control exposure to indirectly assess whether confounding by genetic or shared familial environmental factors associated with depression may explain these associations.
            
            
              Methods
              The study sample came from the population-based Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) that recruited participants from 1999 to 2008. We included 70 959 families where the father completed a questionnaire about medication use in the 6 months prior to pregnancy. In 42 511 infants who completed the 3-year follow-up, we computed Z-scores for the anxiety domain of the Child Behavior Checklist. We used linear and logistic regression to assess the association between paternal antidepressant use, gestational age at birth and child anxiety.
            
            
              Results
              Antidepressants were used by 1.1\% (n = 755) of fathers. Paternal antidepressant use was not associated with gestational age at birth [β = 0.63 days, 95\% confidence interval (CI) –1.56, 0.31] whereas it was positively associated with a child anxiety symptom Z-score and high anxiety symptoms (odds ratio 1.33, 95\% CI 0.90, 1.97) in unadjusted analyses. This association was attenuated when controlling for maternal and paternal history of depression and other measured factors (odds ratio 1.14, 95\% CI 0.76, 1.69).
            
            
              Conclusions
              These results support the suggested effect of maternal use of antidepressants in pregnancy on shorter gestation; however, they suggest familial confounding could explain the association between maternal use of antidepressants and anxiety traits in the offspring.},

This can create unmeasured confounding and lead to nonuniform treatment effects over the propensity score (PS). The authors compared bias and mean squared error for various PS implementations under PS trimming, thereby excluding persons treated contrary to prediction. Cohort studies were simulated with a binary treatment T as a function of 8 covariates X. Two of the covariates were assumed to be unmeasured strong risk factors for the outcome and present in persons treated contrary to prediction. The outcome Y was simulated as a Poisson function of T and all X's. In analyses based on measured covariates only, the range of PS's was trimmed asymmetrically according to the percentile of PS in treated patients at the lower end and in untreated patients at the upper end. PS trimming reduced bias due to unmeasured confounders and mean squared error in most scenarios assessed. Treatment effect estimates based on PS range restrictions do not correspond to a causal parameter but may be less biased by such unmeasured confounding. Increasing validity based on PS trimming may be a unique advantage of PS's over conventional outcome models.},

This goal can often be achieved by choosing well-matched samples of the original treated and control groups, thereby reducing bias due to the covariates. Since the 1970's, work on matching methods has examined how to best choose treated and control subjects for comparison. Matching methods are gaining popularity in fields such as economics, epidemiology, medicine, and political science. However, until now the literature and related advice has been scattered across disciplines. Researchers who are interested in using matching methods-or developing methods related to matching-do not have a single place to turn to learn about past and current research. This paper provides a structure for thinking about matching methods and guidance on their use, coalescing the existing research (both old and new) and providing a summary of where the literature on matching methods is now and where it should be headed.},

	doi = {10.1001/jama.2017.3415},
	abstract = {Importance: Previous observations of a higher risk of child autism spectrum disorder with serotonergic antidepressant exposure during pregnancy may have been confounded.
Objective: To evaluate the association between serotonergic antidepressant exposure during pregnancy and child autism spectrum disorder.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study. Health administrative data sets were used to study children born to mothers who were receiving public prescription drug coverage during pregnancy in Ontario, Canada, from 2002-2010, reflecting 4.2\% of births. Children were followed up until March 31, 2014.
Exposures: Serotonergic antidepressant exposure was defined as 2 or more consecutive maternal prescriptions for a selective serotonin or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor between conception and delivery.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Child autism spectrum disorder identified after the age of 2 years. Exposure group differences were addressed by inverse probability of treatment weighting based on derived high-dimensional propensity scores (computerized algorithm used to select a large number of potential confounders) and by comparing exposed children with unexposed siblings.
Results: There were 35 906 singleton births at a mean gestational age of 38.7 weeks (50.4\% were male, mean maternal age was 26.7 years, and mean duration of follow-up was 4.95 years). In the 2837 pregnancies (7.9\%) exposed to antidepressants, 2.0\% (95\% CI, 1.6\%-2.6\%) of children were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. The incidence of autism spectrum disorder was 4.51 per 1000 person-years among children exposed to antidepressants vs 2.03 per 1000 person-years among unexposed children (between-group difference, 2.48 [95\% CI, 2.33-2.62] per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 2.16 [95\% CI, 1.64-2.86]; adjusted HR, 1.59 [95\% CI, 1.17-2.17]). After inverse probability of treatment weighting based on the high-dimensional propensity score, the association was not significant (HR, 1.61 [95\% CI, 0.997-2.59]). The association was also not significant when exposed children were compared with unexposed siblings (incidence of autism spectrum disorder was 3.40 per 1000 person-years vs 2.05 per 1000 person-years, respectively; adjusted HR, 1.60 [95\% CI, 0.69-3.74]).
Conclusions and Relevance: In children born to mothers receiving public drug coverage in Ontario, Canada, in utero serotonergic antidepressant exposure compared with no exposure was not associated with autism spectrum disorder in the child. Although a causal relationship cannot be ruled out, the previously observed association may be explained by other factors.},

For time-varying covariates, an extended Kaplan–Meier curve has been proposed that is constructed by letting subjects move across risk sets as their covariate levels change during follow-up. It has been claimed, but not proven, that, under a particular independence assumption, this extended Kaplan–Meier curve has a causal interpretation as representing a hypothetical cohort whose covariate values remain constant during follow-up. In this note, we show that, in the absence of confounding, this claim is indeed correct. However, we argue that the causal implications of this independence assumptions are highly unrealistic, and that a causal interpretation of the extended Kaplan–Meier curve is therefore typically unwarranted.},

This meta-ignorance (or ignorance of ignorance) arises because lack of expertise and knowledge often hides in the realm of the “unknown unknowns” or is disguised by erroneous beliefs and background knowledge that only appear to be sufficient to conclude a right answer. As empirical evidence of meta-ignorance, I describe the Dunning–Kruger effect, in which poor performers in many social and intellectual domains seem largely unaware of just how deficient their expertise is. Their deficits leave them with a double burden—not only does their incomplete and misguided knowledge lead them to make mistakes but those exact same deficits also prevent them from recognizing when they are making mistakes and other people choosing more wisely. I discuss theoretical controversies over the interpretation of this effect and describe how the self-evaluation errors of poor and top performers differ. I also address a vexing question: If self-perceptions of competence so often vary from the truth, what cues are people using to determine whether their conclusions are sound or faulty?},

	abstract = {Résumé
					Targets of inference that establish causality are phrased in terms of counterfactual responses to interventions. These potential outcomes operationalize cause effect relationships by means of comparisons of cases and controls in hypothetical randomized controlled experiments. In many applied settings, data on such experiments is not directly available, necessitating assumptions linking the counterfactual target of inference with the factual observed data distribution. This link is provided by causal models. Originally defined on potential outcomes directly (Rubin, 1976), causal models have been extended to longitudinal settings (Robins, 1986), and reformulated as graphical models (Spirtes et al., 2001; Pearl, 2009). In settings where common causes of all observed variables are themselves observed, many causal inference targets are identified via variations of the expression referred to in the literature as the g-formula (Robins, 1986), the manipulated distribution (Spirtes et al., 2001), or the truncated factorization (Pearl, 2009). In settings where hidden variables are present, identification results become considerably more complicated. In this manuscript, we review identification theory in causal models with hidden variables for common targets that arise in causal inference applications, including causal effects, direct, indirect, and path-specific effects, and outcomes of dynamic treatment regimes. We will describe a simple formulation of this theory (Tian and Pearl, 2002; Shpitser and Pearl, 2006b,a; Tian, 2008; Shpitser, 2013) in terms of causal graphical models, and the fixing operator, a statistical analogue of the intervention operation (Richardson et al., 2017).},

	abstract = {Résumé
					Many questions in Data Science are fundamentally causal in that our objective is to learn the effect of some exposure, randomized or not, on an outcome interest. Even studies that are seemingly non-causal, such as those with the goal of prediction or prevalence estimation, have causal elements, including differential censoring or measurement. As a result, we, as Data Scientists, need to consider the underlying causal mechanisms that gave rise to the data, rather than simply the pattern or association observed in those data. In this work, we review the “Causal Roadmap” of Petersen and van der Laan (2014) to provide an introduction to some key concepts in causal inference. Similar to other causal frameworks, the steps of the Roadmap include clearly stating the scientific question, defining of the causal model, translating the scientific question into a causal parameter, assessing the assumptions needed to express the causal parameter as a statistical estimand, implementation of statistical estimators including parametric and semi-parametric methods, and interpretation of our findings. We believe that using such a framework in Data Science will help to ensure that our statistical analyses are guided by the scientific question driving our research, while avoiding over-interpreting our results. We focus on the effect of an exposure occurring at a single time point and highlight the use of targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) with Super Learner.},

In studies with ACR measurements, risk of mortality was unrelated to eGFR between 75 mL/min/1·73 m$^{\textrm{2}}$ and 105 mL/min/1·73 m$^{\textrm{2}}$ and increased at lower eGFRs. Compared with eGFR 95 mL/min/1·73 m$^{\textrm{2}}$, adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality were 1·18 (95\% CI 1·05–1·32) for eGFR 60 mL/min/1·73 m$^{\textrm{2}}$, 1·57 (1·39–1·78) for 45 mL/min/1·73 m$^{\textrm{2}}$, and 3·14 (2·39–4·13) for 15 mL/min/1·73 m$^{\textrm{2}}$.

Adult 1-year cancer survivors without a history ofCVD diagnosed with breast (n = 6762), prostate (n = 4504), non-Hodgkin (n = 1553), Hodgkin (n = 173), lung and trachea (n = 2661), basal cell carcinoma (BCC; n = 12 476), and colorectal (n = 4628) cancer during 1999-2011 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and matched to cancer-free controls without a history ofCVD. Drug dispenses and hospitalizations from thePHARMO Database Network were used as proxy forCVD. Data were analyzed using Cox regression analyses. Prostate (HR: 1.17; 95\%CI: 1.01-1.35) and lung and trachea (HR: 1.48; 95\%CI: 1.10-1.97) cancer survivors had an increased risk for developingCVD compared to cancer-free controls. This increased risk among lung and trachea cancer survivors remained statistically significant after including traditional cardiovascular risk factors and cancer treatment information (HR: 1.41; 95\%CI: 1.06-1.89). Among prostate cancer survivors, the increased risk of incidentCVD was limited to those who received hormones and those without traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Breast, non-Hodgkin,BCC, and colorectal cancer survivors showed no increasedCVD risk compared to cancer-free controls.

The aim of this study was to assess the incidence and risk of cancer and all-cause mortality in a large Danish HF cohort. Methods and results A total of 9307 outpatients with verified HF without a prior diagnosis of cancer (27\% female, mean age 68 years, 89\% with LVEF {\textless}45\%) were included in the study. A diagnosis of any cancer and all-cause mortality was obtained from Danish national registries. Outcome was compared with the general Danish population. Overall and type-specific risk of cancer was analysed in an adjusted Poisson and Cox regression analysis. The 975 diagnoses of cancer in the HF cohort and 330 843 in the background population corresponded to incidence rates per 10 000 patient-years of 188.9 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 177.2–200.6] and 63.0 (95\% CI 63.0–63.4), respectively. When stratified by age, incidence rates were increased in all age groups in the HF cohort. Risk of any type of cancer was increased, with an incidence rate ratio of 1.24 (95\% CI 1.15–1.33, c {\textless} 0.0001). Type-specific analysis demonstrated an increased hazard ratio for all major types of cancer except for prostate cancer. All-cause mortality was higher in HF patients with cancer compared with cancer patients from the background population. Conclusions Patients with HF have an increased risk of cancer, which persists after the first year after the diagnosis of HF, and their prognosis is worse compared with that of cancer patients without HF.},

	abstract = {Introduction We investigated risk of coronary heart disease and heart failure in phenotypes of obstructive airway disease.
Methods Among 91 692 participants in the Copenhagen General Population Study, 42 058 individuals were classified with no respiratory disease, and 11 988 individuals had different phenotypes of obstructive airways disease: asthma with early onset or late-onset, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) above or below 50\% of predicted value (\%p) or asthma-COPD overlap (ACO).
Results During a mean follow-up of 5.7 years we registered 3584 admissions for coronary heart disease and 1590 admissions for heart failure. Multivariable Cox regression analyses of time to first admission were used with a two-sided p value of 0.05 as significance level. Compared with no respiratory disease the highest risks of coronary heart disease and heart failure were observed in ACO with late-onset asthma and FEV1 {\textless}50\% p, HR=2.2 (95\% CI 1.6 to 3.0), and HR=2.9 (95\% CI 2.0 to 4.3), respectively. In COPD with FEV1 above 50\% p the HRs were 1.3 (95\% CI 1.2 to 1.5) for coronary heart disease and 1.9 (95\% CI 1.6 to 2.3) for heart failure. Asthma associated with increased risks of coronary heart disease and heart failure, however, in asthma without allergy the HR was 1.1 (95\% CI 0.7 to 1.6) for coronary heart disease while individuals with allergy had an HR of 1.4 (95\% CI 1.1 to 1.6).
Conclusions Risks of coronary heart disease and heart failure were increased in asthma, COPD and ACO. In asthma, the risk of coronary heart disease depended on presence of allergy. We suggest that cardiovascular risk factors should be assessed systematically in individuals with obstructive airway disease with the potential to facilitate targeted treatments.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a population-based study of health care resource use of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared to non-COPD controls. Through a screening of the Danish Patient Registry for patients admitted with COPD diagnoses for a 5-year period, 1998–2002, 66,000 individuals with COPD still alive at the beginning of 2002 were identified. Their use of health care resources in 2002 were compared with equivalent data, stratified for age, sex and mortality rates, for a control population without COPD based on data for the 300,000 remaining patients on the Danish Patient Registry in 2002. Results indicated that the gross cost of treating patients with COPD in the Danish somatic hospital and primary health care sector corresponded to 10\% of the total cost of treating patients of 40 years or more. The net cost for COPD patients was 1.9 billion DKK (256 million €), 6\% of the total annual costs of treating the population of 40 years or more. The gross cost related to any disease and the net cost reflected the resource use which could be attributed to COPD and its related diagnoses. The incidence of inpatient hospital admissions was almost four times higher in the COPD population than in the control group. COPD patients contacted their general practitioner 12 times more per year than non-COPD controls, but for specialist and paramedic treatment in the primary care sector there was no significant difference between COPD patients and non-COPD controls. Only one third of the COPD costs were due to treatment of COPD as the primary diagnosis. The remaining two-thirds of the COPD-related costs were mainly due to admissions for other diseases such as cardio-vascular diseases, other respiratory diseases, and cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Persons with mental disorders are at a higher risk than the general population for the subsequent development of certain medical conditions.
METHODS We used a population-based cohort from Danish national registries that included data on more than 5.9 million persons born in Denmark from 1900 through 2015 and followed them from 2000 through 2016, for a total of 83.9 million personyears. We assessed 10 broad types of mental disorders and 9 broad categories of medical conditions (which encompassed 31 specific conditions). We used Cox regression models to calculate overall hazard ratios and time-dependent hazard ratios for pairs of mental disorders and medical conditions, after adjustment for age, sex, calendar time, and previous mental disorders. Absolute risks were estimated with the use of competing-risks survival analyses. The authors’ full names, academic degrees, and affiliations are listed in the Appendix.

RESULTS A total of 698,874 of 5,940,299 persons (11.8\%) were identified as having a mental disorder. The median age of the total population was 32.1 years at entry into the cohort and 48.7 years at the time of the last follow-up. Persons with a mental disorder had a higher risk than those without such disorders with respect to 76 of 90 pairs of mental disorders and medical conditions. The median hazard ratio for an association between a mental disorder and a medical condition was 1.37. The lowest hazard ratio was 0.82 for organic mental disorders and the broad category of cancer (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.80 to 0.84), and the highest was 3.62 for eating disorders and urogenital conditions (95\% CI, 3.11 to 4.22). Several specific pairs showed a reduced risk (e.g., schizophrenia and musculoskeletal conditions). Risks varied according to the time since the diagnosis of a mental disorder. The absolute risk of a medical condition within 15 years after a mental disorder was diagnosed varied from 0.6\% for a urogenital condition among persons with a developmental disorder to 54.1\% for a circulatory disorder among those with an organic mental disorder.
CONCLUSIONS Most mental disorders were associated with an increased risk of a subsequent medical condition; hazard ratios ranged from 0.82 to 3.62 and varied according to the time since the diagnosis of the mental disorder.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is linked to risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in diabetes, but the nature of the association is unclear. We investigated the association between MBL and the risk of cardiovascular events (CVE) and all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a cohort study of 7,588 patients with type 2 diabetes, we measured serum MBL in 7,305 patients and performed MBL expression genotyping in 3,043 patients. We grouped serum MBL and MBL expression genotypes into three categories: low, intermediate, and high. Outcomes were CVE (myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, unstable angina, or cardiovascular death) and all-cause mortality. The association with outcomes was examined by spline and Cox regression analyses.
RESULTS Serum MBL and CVE showed a U-shaped association. Compared with the intermediate serum MBL category, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for CVE was 1.82 (95\% CI, 1.34–2.46) for the low-MBL category and 1.48 (95\% CI, 1.14–1.92) for the high-MBL category. We found a similar U-shaped association for all-cause mortality, but with lower risk estimates. Compared with the intermediate MBL expression genotype, the adjusted HR for CVE was 1.40 (95\% CI, 0.87–2.25) for the low-expression genotype and 1.44 (95\% CI, 1.01–2.06) for the high-expression genotype. MBL expression genotype was not associated with all-cause mortality.
CONCLUSIONS Both serum MBL and MBL expression genotype showed a U-shaped association with CVE risk in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Our findings suggest that serum MBL is a risk factor for CVD in this population.},

	doi = {10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.13880},
	abstract = {Importance: During the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, case reports have suggested that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may lead to adverse outcomes.
Objective: To study the association of NSAID use with adverse outcomes in patients hospitalized with influenza or influenza pneumonia.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used propensity score matching among 7747 individuals aged 40 years or older who were hospitalized with influenza, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction or antigen testing, between 2010 and 2018. Data were collected using Danish nationwide registers. All analyses reported were performed on May 29, 2020.
Exposures: Prescription fill of an NSAID within 60 days before admission.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) with 95\% CIs for intensive care unit admission and death within 30 days of admission.
Results: A total of 7747 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 71 [59-80] years, 3980 [51.4\%] men) with confirmed influenza were identified. Of these, 520 (6.7\%) were exposed to NSAIDs. In the unmatched cohorts, 104 of 520 patients (20.0\%) who used NSAIDs and 958 of 7227 patients (13.3\%) who did not use NSAIDs were admitted to the intensive care unit. For death within 30 days of admission, we observed 37 events (7.1\%) among those who used NSAIDs compared with 563 events (7.8\%) among those who did not. Current NSAID use was associated with intensive care unit admission (RR, 1.51; 95\% CI, 1.26 to 1.81; RD, 6.7\%; 95\% CI, 3.2\% to 10.3\%), while NSAID use was not associated with death (RR, 0.91; 95\% CI, 0.66 to 1.26; RD, -0.7\%; 95\% CI, -3.0\% to 1.6\%). In the matched cohorts, risks were unchanged for patients who used NSAIDs, while 83 ICU admissions (16.0\%) and 36 deaths (6.9\%) were observed among matched individuals who did not use NSAIDs. Matched (ie, adjusted) analyses yielded attenuated risk estimates for intensive care unit admission (RR, 1.25; 95\% CI, 0.95 to 1.63; RD, 4.0\%; 95\% CI, -0.6\% to 8.7\%) and death (RR, 1.03; 95\% CI, 0.66 to 1.60; RD, 0.2\%; 95\% CI, -2.9\% to 3.3\%). Associations were more pronounced among patients who used NSAIDs for a longer period (eg, for intensive care unit admission: RR, 1.90; 95\% CI, 1.19 to 3.06; RD, 13.4\%; 95\% CI, 4.0\% to 22.8\%).
Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of adult patients hospitalized with influenza, the use of NSAIDs was not associated with 30-day intensive care unit admission or death in adjusted analyses. There was an association between long-term use of NSAIDs and intensive care unit admission.},

Method Data were collated from 20 population-based registers contributing to the Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe database. Trend analyses were conducted in four birthweight groups: {\textless}1000g (extremely low birthweight [ELBW]); 1000 to 1499g (very low birthweight [VLBW]); 1500 to 2499g (moderately low birthweight [MLBW]); and {\textgreater}2499g (normal birthweight [NBW]). Results The overall prevalence of CP decreased from 1.90 to 1.77 per 1000 live births, p{\textless}0.001, with a mean annual fall of 0.7\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] −0.3\% to −1.0\%). Prevalence in NBW children showed a non-significant trend from 1.17 to 0.89 per 1000 live births (p=0.22). Prevalence in MLBW children decreased from 8.5 to 6.2 per 1000 live births (p{\textless}0.001), but not linearly. Prevalence in VLBW children also declined from 70.9 to 35.9 per 1000 live births (p{\textless}0.001) with a mean annual fall of 3.4\% (95\% CI −2.4\% to −4.3\%). Prevalence in ELBW children remained stable, at a mean rate of 42.4 per 1000 live births. Interpretation The decline in prevalence of CP in children of VLBW continues, and confirms that previously reported. For the first time, there is also a significant decline among those of MLBW, resulting in a significant overall decrease in the prevalence of CP.},

The rate for infants of 31 weeks' gestation or more did not change, whereas a significant increase was observed in infants below 31 weeks (85–123 per 1000, P {\textless} 0.05). In the same periods, perinatal mortality in eastern Denmark decreased significantly from 8.6 to 7.8 per 1000. The decrease in stillbirth rate was significant in all subgroups of gestational ages except in those of 28–30 weeks' gestation. The early neonatal mortality rate decreased significantly only in infants below 31 weeks (282–239 per 1000, P {\textless} 0.05). Thus, in eastern Denmark, cerebral palsy birth prevalence has increased from birth-year period 1979–82 to 1983–86 because of an increased rate in preterm infants below 31 weeks, who at the same time had a reduced risk of early neonatal death.},

	abstract = {Aim
To analyse trends in prevalence and severity of cerebral palsy (CP) in Denmark in birth years 1999–2007 and compare with previous periods.
Method
Data has been collected uniformly in the Danish cerebral palsy national register nationwide since 1995. Rates in the time periods 1999–2001, 2002–2004 and 2005–2007 covering 585,393 births were analysed by gestational age and subtypes.
Results
Total number of CP cases in the period was 1165. The overall prevalence of CP decreased significantly from 2.1 in 1999–2001 to 1.8 in 2005–2007 per 1000 livebirths (p = 0.022). The decline was only significant for children born at term (p = 0.007) but not for the preterm (p = 0.44). The decline in children born at term was based on a decrease in bilateral spastic CP (n = 117 in years 1999–2001 and n = 59 in 2005–2007). Multidisciplinary obstetric skills training with neonatal resuscitation in Denmark was initiated in 2003 and timely associated with the decrease. The prevalence of unilateral spastic CP the prevalence did not change, but in the two last time periods more children had a right-sided than left-sided unilateral spastic CP.
Conclusion
The decline in rate of CP seen in 2005–2007 as compared to 1999–2001 was mainly based on fewer cases of severe spastic CP in term infants. We hypothesize that improved neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room may be partly responsible for the decrease. In premature children the decline was not significant in this time period, but has been dramatically decreasing in the years before the time period here analysed.},

METHOD: From a total of 4568 participants, a representative random subsample of n=387 patients were used to validate the diagnosis. Patient files were systematically scored for the presence of ICD-10 criteria for HD and oppositional defiant disorder/conduct disorder (ODD/CD; F91). Further to this, an inter-rater reliability study was also conducted, whereby two experienced child and adolescent psychiatrists who were blind to patients discharge diagnoses, rated a random subsample of n=101 participants.
RESULTS: Information was available for 372 out of 387 patients. Out of n=372 available files, n=324 (86.8\%) were evaluated to fulfil diagnostic criteria for HD. Due to missing information it was not possible to reach a conclusion for 5.1\% of the cases, 3.8\% of the diagnoses were registration errors, and in 4.3\% of the files the diagnosis had to be rejected. Inter-rater agreement was high (κ=0.83, z=10.9, P{\textless}.001). The validity of hyperkinetic disorders, unspecified (F90.9) was lower and comorbid CD/ODD were under-diagnosed in the sample. All participants fulfilling HD criteria also fulfilled DSM-5-criteria for ADHD.
CONCLUSION: The risk of misclassification of patients with HD in the DPCRR is relatively low, with the exception of the diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorders, unspecified (F90.9).},

	abstract = {Background
Children of immigrants in Denmark have excess risk for some of the most well-established risk factors for cerebral palsy (CP).
Objectives
To study differences in risk of CP between children of immigrants and children of Danish-born mothers, and explore whether socioeconomic status drives any potential association.
Methods
A register-based cohort study including 1,274,616 children born in Denmark between 1981 and 2007. Of these, 2807 had a validated CP diagnosis in the Danish CP Register. We estimated the risk of CP as odds ratios (OR) using logistic regression and assessed mediation through socioeconomic status using natural effect models.
Results
In children of Danish-born mothers, 2.2/1000 had CP overall and the prevalence was similar for children of immigrants. However, children of immigrants had lower risk of unilateral spastic CP than children of Danish native-born mothers; OR = 0.59 (95\% CI:0.38–0.91) for Western and OR = 0.79 (95\% CI:0.61–1.03) for Non-Western immigrants. By contrast, the risk of bilateral spastic CP was higher in children of Non-Western immigrants (OR = 1.27 (95\% CI:1.05–1.53)), especially from Turkey and Pakistan compared with children of Danish native-born mothers. The mediation analysis revealed an indirect effect (through maternal educational level and household income) with an OR of 1.06 (95\% CI:0.99–1.14) for children of Non-Western immigrants.
Conclusions
While children of immigrants had lower risk of unilateral spastic CP than children of Danish-born mothers, the risk of bilateral spastic CP was increased in children of Non-Western immigrants. Socioeconomic status did not appear to be a significant contributor to the increased risk of bilateral spastic CP.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy is the most frequent motor disability in childhood, but little is known about its etiology. It has been suggested that cerebral palsy risk may be increased by prenatal thyroid hormone disturbances. The objective of this study was to investigate whether maternal thyroid disorder is associated with increased risk of cerebral palsy.
METHODS: A population-based cohort study using two study populations. 1) 1,270,079 children born in Denmark 1979-2007 identified in nationwide registers, and 2) 192,918 children born 1996-2009 recruited into the Danish National Birth Cohort and The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort study, combined in the MOthers and BAbies in Norway and Denmark (MOBAND) collaboration cohort. Register-based and self-reported information on maternal thyroid disorder was studied in relation to risk of cerebral palsy and its unilateral and bilateral spastic subtypes using multiple logistic regression. Children were followed from the age of 1 year to the age of 6 years, and cerebral palsy was identified in nationwide registers with verified diagnoses.
RESULTS: In register data, hypothyroidism was recognized in 12,929 (1.0\%), hyperthyroidism in 9943 (0.8\%), and unclassifiable thyroid disorder in 753 ({\textless} 0.1\%) of the mothers. The odds ratio for an association between maternal thyroid disorder and bilateral spastic cerebral palsy was 1.0 (95\% CI: 0.7-1.5). Maternal thyroid disorder identified during pregnancy was associated with elevated risk of unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (odds ratio 3.1 (95\% CI: 1.2-8.4)). In MOBAND, 3042 (1.6\%) of the mothers reported a thyroid disorder in pregnancy, which was not associated with cerebral palsy overall (odds ratio 1.2 (95\% CI: 0.6-2.4)).
CONCLUSIONS: Maternal thyroid disorder overall was not related to bilateral spastic cerebral palsy, but maternal thyroid disorder identified in pregnancy was associated with increased risk of unilateral spastic cerebral palsy. These findings should be replicated in studies making use of maternal blood samples.},

	abstract = {Background: We investigated whether the risk of cerebral palsy (CP) in the child varies by parents' socioeconomic status, in Denmark and Norway.
Methods: We included almost 1.3 million children born in Demark during 1981-2007 and 2.4 million children born in Norway during 1967-2007, registered in the Medical Birth registries. Data on births were linked to Statistics Denmark and Norway to retrieve information on parents' education and relationship status and, in Denmark, also income. CP diagnoses were obtained from linkage with national registries. We used multivariate log-binominal regression models to estimate relative risk (RR) of CP according to parental socioeconomic status.
Results: There was a strong trend of decreasing risk of CP with additional education of both the mother and the father. These trends were nearly identical for the two parents, with a one-third reduction in risk for those with the highest education compared with parents with the lowest education. When both parents had high education, risk of CP was further reduced (RR 0.58, 0.53-0.63). Women with partners had a reduction in risk (RR 0.79, 0.74-0.85) compared with single mothers overall. Risk patterns were stable over time, across countries and within spastic bilateral and unilateral CP. Household income was not associated with risk of CP.
Conclusions: Risk of CP in two Scandinavian countries was lower among educated parents and mothers with a partner, but unrelated to income. Factors underlying this stable association with education are unknown, but could include differences in potentially modifiable lifestyle factors and health behaviours.},

	abstract = {Cerebral palsy (CP) is the commonest disabling impairment in childhood, with a prevalence of 2-3 per 1000 live births. The Danish Cerebral Palsy Registry is a research registry that contains cases of CP from birth year 1925 and has estimated the birth prevalence since 1950. Data on children with CP are collected from paediatric departments and one special institution for disabled children. The children are included by a child neurologist and an obstetrician, and information on pregnancy, birth, neonatal period, impairments and demographic data on the child and mother are registered in a standard form. The uptake area is eastern Denmark, covering about 50\% of the population, but the rest of Denmark is planned to be included from 2001. The Registry is large, well established and validated, and the definitions and collection procedures have not changed through several decades. It therefore has great research potential. Birth prevalence is estimated continuously, and changes over time are analysed and correlated with pre- and perinatal conditions. A correlation between increased survival of preterm babies and an increased prevalence was found previously, and a decreased prevalence in very preterm infants was later associated with less use of mechanical ventilation. A study correlating CP and maternal infection is ongoing. Collaboration between 14 European CP registries allows the true differences in prevalence between different countries to be studied. Linkage to other individually based registries in Denmark will allow the social consequences of CP to be described.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To estimate the occurrence of epilepsy in Denmark between 1977 and 2002, taking gender, age, and secular trends into consideration.
Methods
We used the Danish Civil Registration System to identify all persons born in Denmark and the Danish National Hospital Register to identify persons registered with epilepsy between 1977 and 2002.
Results
Between 1977 and 2002 the average incidence of epilepsy was 68.8 new epilepsy patients per 100,000 person-years at risk. However, the incidence changed with calendar time and increased steeply from 1990 to 1995, probably due to changes in diagnostic system and inclusion of outpatients. From 1995 to 2002 the incidence rate was reasonable constant with an average of 83.3 new cases per 100,000 person-years at risk, except for patients over 60 years of age where we observed an increase in incidence with calendar time. The age-specific incidence rates declined from a high level in children to a low level between 20 and 40 years of age, and thereafter a gradual increase was seen. The incidence rate was slightly higher in men than in women except for the age range 10–20 years. About 2\% of the population was diagnosed with epilepsy at some point during the first 25 years of life. The overall 5-year prevalence proportion of epilepsy was 0.6\% with a slight variation with age and gender between 0.4 and 0.8\% of the population.
Conclusion
The occurrence of epilepsy is age and gender specific. The estimated incidence rate of epilepsy furthermore increased over time for persons older than 60 years of age.},

	abstract = {Background
The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of cerebral palsy (CP) as well as to characterize the CP population, its participation in a secondary prevention programme (CPUP) and to validate the CPUP database.

Methods
The study population was born 1990–1997 and resident in Skåne/Blekinge on Jan 1st 2002. Multiple sources were used. Irrespective of earlier diagnoses, neuropaediatrician and other professional medical records were evaluated for all children at the child habilitation units. The CPUP database and diagnosis registers at hospital departments were searched for children with CP or psychomotor retardation, whose records were then evaluated. To enhance early prevention, CP/probable CP was searched for also in children below four years of age born 1998–2001.

Results
The prevalence of CP was 2.4/1,000 (95\% CI 2.1–2.6) in children 4–11 years of age born in Sweden, excluding post-neonatally acquired CP. Children born abroad had a higher prevalence of CP with more severe functional limitations. In the total population, the prevalence of CP was 2.7/1,000 (95\% CI 2.4–3.0) and 48\% were GMFCS-level I (the mildest limitation of gross motor function)., One third of the children with CP, who were born or had moved into the area after a previous study in 1998, were not in the CPUP database. The subtype classification in the CPUP database was adjusted in the case of every fifth child aged 4–7 years not previously reviewed.

Conclusion
The prevalence of CP and the subtype distribution did not differ from that reported in other studies, although the proportion of mild CP tended to be higher., The availability of a second opinion about the classification of CP/CP subtypes is necessary in order to keep a CP register valid, as well as an active search for undiagnosed CP among children with other impairments.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Epilepsy affects 0.5\% to 1\% of children and is the most frequent chronic neurologic condition in childhood. Incidence rates appear to be declining in high-income countries. The validity of epilepsy diagnoses from different data sources varies, and contemporary population-based incidence studies are needed.
METHODS: The study was based on the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Potential epilepsy cases were identified through registry linkages and parental questionnaires. Cases were validated through medical record reviews and telephone interviews of parents.
RESULTS: The study population included 112 744 children aged 3 to 13 years (mean 7.4 years) at end of registry follow-up (December 31, 2012). Of these, 896 had registry recordings and/or questionnaire reports of epilepsy. After validation, 587 (66\%) met the criteria for an epilepsy diagnosis. The incidence rate of epilepsy was 144 per 100 000 person-years in the first year of life and 58 per 100 000 for ages 1 to 10 years. The cumulative incidence of epilepsy was 0.66\% at age 10 years, with 0.62\% having active epilepsy. The 309 children (34\%) with erroneous reports of epilepsy from the registry and/or the questionnaires had mostly been evaluated for nonepileptic paroxysmal events, or they had undergone electroencephalography examinations because of other developmental or neurocognitive difficulties.
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 1 out of 150 children is diagnosed with epilepsy during the first 10 years of life, with the highest incidence rate observed during infancy. Validation of epilepsy diagnoses in administrative data and cohort studies is crucial because reported diagnoses may not meet diagnostic criteria for epilepsy.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Valproate is used for the treatment of epilepsy and other neuropsychological disorders and may be the only treatment option for women of childbearing potential. However, prenatal exposure to valproate may increase the risk of autism.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether prenatal exposure to valproate is associated with an increased risk of autism in offspring.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based study of all children born alive in Denmark from 1996 to 2006. National registers were used to identify children exposed to valproate during pregnancy and diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (childhood autism [autistic disorder], Asperger syndrome, atypical autism, and other or unspecified pervasive developmental disorders). We analyzed the risks associated with all autism spectrum disorders as well as childhood autism. Data were analyzed by Cox regression adjusting for potential confounders (maternal age at conception, paternal age at conception, parental psychiatric history, gestational age, birth weight, sex, congenital malformations, and parity). Children were followed up from birth until the day of autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, death, emigration, or December 31, 2010, whichever came first.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Absolute risk (cumulative incidence) and the hazard ratio (HR) of autism spectrum disorder and childhood autism in children after exposure to valproate in pregnancy.
RESULTS: Of 655,615 children born from 1996 through 2006, 5437 were identified with autism spectrum disorder, including 2067 with childhood autism. The mean age of the children at end of follow-up was 8.84 years (range, 4-14; median, 8.85). The estimated absolute risk after 14 years of follow-up was 1.53\% (95\% CI, 1.47\%-1.58\%) for autism spectrum disorder and 0.48\% (95\% CI, 0.46\%-0.51\%) for childhood autism. Overall, the 508 children exposed to valproate had an absolute risk of 4.42\% (95\% CI, 2.59\%-7.46\%) for autism spectrum disorder (adjusted HR, 2.9 [95\% CI, 1.7-4.9]) and an absolute risk of 2.50\% (95\% CI, 1.30\%-4.81\%) for childhood autism (adjusted HR, 5.2 [95\% CI, 2.7-10.0]). When restricting the cohort to the 6584 children born to women with epilepsy, the absolute risk of autism spectrum disorder among 432 children exposed to valproate was 4.15\% (95\% CI, 2.20\%-7.81\%) (adjusted HR, 1.7 [95\% CI, 0.9-3.2]), and the absolute risk of childhood autism was 2.95\% (95\% CI, 1.42\%-6.11\%) (adjusted HR, 2.9 [95\% CI, 1.4-6.0]) vs 2.44\% (95\% CI, 1.88\%-3.16\%) for autism spectrum disorder and 1.02\% (95\% CI, 0.70\%-1.49\%) for childhood autism among 6152 children not exposed to valproate.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Maternal use of valproate during pregnancy was associated with a significantly increased risk of autism spectrum disorder and childhood autism in the offspring, even after adjusting for maternal epilepsy. For women of childbearing potential who use antiepileptic medications, these findings must be balanced against the treatment benefits for women who require valproate for epilepsy control.},

Objective: To determine whether prenatal exposure to valproate and other AEDs is associated with an increased risk of ADHD in the offspring.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a population-based cohort study of all live-born singleton children in Denmark from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2011 (N = 913 302). Information on prenatal exposure to AEDs, including valproate, was obtained from the Danish National Prescription Registry and all children with ADHD were identified (children with diagnosed ADHD in the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register or children who redeemed a prescription for ADHD medication). The cohort was followed up from birth until the day of the ADHD diagnosis, death, emigration, or December 31, 2015, whichever came first. Data were analyzed in September 2018.
Exposures: Maternal use of valproate and other AEDs in pregnancy.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Cox regression estimates of the hazard ratio of ADHD. Estimates were adjusted for potential confounders.
Results: The cohort included 913 302 children (mean age at end of study, 10.1 years; median age, 9.4 years; interquartile range, 7.2-12.8 years; 468 708 [51.3\%] male). A total of 580 were identified as having been exposed to valproate during pregnancy; of them, 49 (8.4\%) had ADHD. Among the 912 722 children who were unexposed to valproate, 29 396 (3.2\%) had ADHD. Children with prenatal valproate exposure had a 48\% increased risk of ADHD (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.48; 95\% CI, 1.09-2.00) compared with children with no valproate exposure. The absolute 15-year risk of ADHD was 4.6\% (95\% CI, 4.5\%-4.6\%) in children unexposed to valproate and 11.0\% (95\% CI, 8.2\%-14.2\%) in children who were exposed to valproate in pregnancy. No associations were found between other AEDs and ADHD.
Conclusions and Relevance: Maternal use of valproate, but not other AEDs, during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in the offspring. These findings have important implications for the counseling of women of childbearing potential using valproate.},

	abstract = {Purpose To assess the validity of dispensed prescription to classify exposure to medications used episodically during pregnancy, and to explore individual trajectories of episodic medication use across pregnancy, using triptans for migraine as the motivating example. Methods We compared self-reported triptan use during pregnancy in The Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) to dispensed prescriptions in The Norwegian Prescription Database and calculated Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ), sensitivity, specificity and predictive values using MoBa as reference standard. We used group-based trajectory modeling to estimate exposure trajectories in MoBa according to probability of triptan use across pregnancy. Results We identified 6051 pregnancies where mothers filled at least one triptan prescription or reported migraine or triptan use in the 6 months before or during pregnancy. Sensitivity of prescribed triptans during pregnancy was low (39.1\%), but specificity was quite high (95.4\%). Agreement between the two data sources was fair (κ 0.36). We identified three trajectory groups in MoBa including constant-high, decreasing-medium and decreasing-low probability of triptan use across pregnancy. Conclusions Using dispensed prescriptions rather than self-report to classify exposure to triptans during pregnancy is likely to result in substantial under-estimation of exposure. In this study, traditional definitions of ever-exposed vs never-exposed failed to capture variations in drug utilization during pregnancy.},

              is a Gram-negative bacterium that can be classified into typeable (types a through f) and non-typeable (NTHi) groups. This opportunistic pathogen asymptomatically colonizes the mucosal epithelium of the upper respiratory tract, from where it spreads to other neighboring regions, potentially leading to disease. Infection with NTHi can cause otitis media, sinusitis, conjunctivitis, exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia, but is increasingly causing invasive disease including bacteremia and meningitis. Invasive NTHi strains are more resistant to complement-mediated killing. However, the mechanisms of complement resistance have never been studied in large numbers of invasive NTHi strains.
            
            
              In this study, we determined the relationship between binding of IgG or IgM and the bacterial survival in normal human serum for 267 invasive

              strains from Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, of which the majority (200, 75\%), were NTHi.
            
            NTHi bacteria opsonized with high levels of IgM had the lowest survival in human serum. IgM binding to the bacterial surface, but not IgG binding, was shown to be associated with complement-mediated killing of NTHi strains. We conclude that evasion of IgM binding by NTHi strains increases survival in blood, thereby potentially contributing to their ability to cause severe invasive diseases.},

It then discusses several properties of P-values that have been presented as fatal flaws: That P-values exhibit extreme variation across samples (and thus are “unreliable”), confound effect size with sample size, are sensitive to sample size, and depend on investigator sampling intentions. These properties are often criticized from a likelihood or Bayesian framework, yet they are exactly the properties P-values should exhibit when they are constructed and interpreted correctly within their originating framework. Other common criticisms are that P-values force users to focus on irrelevant hypotheses and overstate evidence against those hypotheses. These problems are not however properties of P-values but are faults of researchers who focus on null hypotheses and overstate evidence based on misperceptions that p = 0.05 represents enough evidence to reject hypotheses. Those problems are easily seen without use of Bayesian concepts by translating the observed P-value p into the Shannon information (S-value or surprisal) –log2(p).},

This point was made clear by Hernán (Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass) 21(1):13-15, 2010) in a commentary, which emphasised that the hazard ratio contrasts populations of treated and untreated individuals who survived a given period of time, populations that will typically fail to be comparable-even in a randomised trial-as a result of different pressures or intensities acting on different populations. The commentary has been very influential, but also a source of surprise and confusion. In this note, we aim to provide more insight into the subtle interpretation of hazard ratios and differences, by investigating in particular what can be learned about a treatment effect from the hazard ratio becoming 1 (or the hazard difference 0) after a certain period of time. We further define a hazard ratio that has a causal interpretation and study its relationship to the Cox hazard ratio, and we also define a causal hazard difference. These quantities are of theoretical interest only, however, since they rely on assumptions that cannot be empirically evaluated. Throughout, we will focus on the analysis of randomised experiments.},

However, it may not be straightforward to interpret the hazard ratio clinically and statistically when the proportional hazards assumption is invalid. In some recent papers published in clinical journals, the use of restricted mean survival time (RMST) or τ-year mean survival time is discussed as one of the alternative summary measures for the time-to-event outcome. The RMST is defined as the expected value of time to event limited to a specific time point corresponding to the area under the survival curve up to the specific time point. This article summarizes the necessary information to conduct statistical analysis using the RMST, including the definition and statistical properties of the RMST, adjusted analysis methods, sample size calculation, information fraction for the RMST difference, and clinical and statistical meaning and interpretation. Additionally, we discuss how to set the specific time point to define the RMST from two main points of view. We also provide developed SAS codes to determine the sample size required to detect an expected RMST difference with appropriate power and reconstruct individual survival data to estimate an RMST reference value from a reported survival curve.},

	abstract = {Both delayed study entry (left-truncation) and competing risks are common phenomena in observational time-to-event studies. For example, in studies conducted by Teratology Information Services (TIS) on adverse drug reactions during pregnancy, the natural time scale is gestational age, but women enter the study after time origin and upon contact with the service. Competing risks are present, because an elective termination may be precluded by a spontaneous abortion. If left-truncation is entirely random, the Aalen-Johansen estimator is the canonical estimator of the cumulative incidence functions of the competing events. If the assumption of random left-truncation is in doubt, we propose a new semiparametric estimator of the cumulative incidence function. The dependence between entry time and time-to-event is modeled using a cause-specific Cox proportional hazards model and the marginal (unconditional) estimates are derived via inverse probability weighting arguments. We apply the new estimator to data about coumarin usage during pregnancy. Here, the concern is that the cause-specific hazard of experiencing an induced abortion may depend on the time when seeking advice by a TIS, which also is the time of left-truncation or study entry. While the aims of counseling by a TIS are to reduce the rate of elective terminations based on irrational overestimation of drug risks and to lead to better and safer medical treatment of maternal disease, it is conceivable that women considering an induced abortion are more likely to seek counseling. The new estimator is also evaluated in extensive simulation studies and found preferable compared to the Aalen-Johansen estimator in non–misspecified scenarios and to at least provide for a sensitivity analysis otherwise.},

	abstract = {Epilepsy is a chronic disease of the brain characterized by an enduring (i.e., persisting) predisposition to generate seizures, unprovoked by any immediate central nervous system insult, and by the neurobiologic, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of seizure recurrences. Epilepsy affects both sexes and all ages with worldwide distribution. The prevalence and the incidence of epilepsy are slightly higher in men compared to women and tend to peak in the elderly, reflecting the higher frequency of stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, and tumors in this age-group. Focal seizures are more common than generalized seizures both in children and in adults. The etiology of epilepsy varies according to the sociodemographic characteristics of the affected populations and the extent of the diagnostic workup, but a documented cause is still lacking in about 50\% of cases from high-income countries (HIC). The overall prognosis of epilepsy is favorable in the majority of patients when measured by seizure freedom. Reports from low/middle-income countries (LMIC; where patients with epilepsy are largely untreated) give prevalence and remission rates that overlap those of HICs. As the incidence of epilepsy appears higher in most LMICs, the overlapping prevalence can be explained by misdiagnosis, acute symptomatic seizures and premature mortality. Studies have consistently shown that about one-half of cases tend to achieve prolonged seizure remission. However, more recent reports on the long-term prognosis of epilepsy have identified differing prognostic patterns, including early and late remission, a relapsing-remitting course, and even a worsening course (characterized by remission followed by relapse and unremitting seizures). Epilepsy \textit{per se} carries a low mortality risk, but significant differences in mortality rates are expected when comparing incidence and prevalence studies, children and adults, and persons with idiopathic and symptomatic seizures. Sudden unexplained death is most frequent in people with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, nocturnal seizures, and drug refractory epilepsy.},

	abstract = {Objective The aim of this study was to examine the association between biological, behavioural and lifestyle risk factors and risk of miscarriage. Design Population-based case–control study. Setting Case–control study nested within a population-based, two-stage postal survey of reproductive histories of women randomly sampled from the UK electoral register. Population Six hundred and three women aged 18–55 years whose most recent pregnancy had ended in first trimester miscarriage ({\textless}13 weeks of gestation; cases) and 6116 women aged 18–55 years whose most recent pregnancy had progressed beyond 12 weeks (controls). Methods Women were questioned about socio-demographic, behavioural and other factors in their most recent pregnancy. Main outcome measure First trimester miscarriage. Results After adjustment for confounding, the following were independently associated with increased risk: high maternal age; previous miscarriage, termination and infertility; assisted conception; low pre-pregnancy body mass index; regular or high alcohol consumption; feeling stressed (including trend with number of stressful or traumatic events); high paternal age and changing partner. Previous live birth, nausea, vitamin supplementation and eating fresh fruits and vegetables daily were associated with reduced risk, as were feeling well enough to fly or to have sex. After adjustment for nausea, we did not confirm an association with caffeine consumption, smoking or moderate or occasional alcohol consumption; nor did we find an association with educational level, socio-economic circumstances or working during pregnancy. Conclusions The results confirm that advice to encourage a healthy diet, reduce stress and promote emotional wellbeing might help women in early pregnancy (or planning a pregnancy) reduce their risk of miscarriage. Findings of increased risk associated with previous termination, stress, change of partner and low pre-pregnancy weight are noteworthy, and we recommend further work to confirm these findings in other study populations.},

METHODS: Data were collected by linkage to state-based perinatal repositories and cerebral palsy registers and using a maternal questionnaire. The cohort included 587 individuals with cerebral palsy and 1,154 non-cerebral palsy controls.
RESULTS: The following factors were associated with cerebral palsy: recorded maternal infection during pregnancy (41.4\% patients compared with 31.3\% controls; odds ratio [OR] 1.55, 95\% confidence interval 1.26-1.91), small for gestational age ([birth weight less than third customized centile] 43.9\% patients compared with 6.3\% controls; OR 11.75, 6.25-22.08), gestational age less than 32 weeks (29.3\% patients compared with 0.7\% controls; OR 59.20, 28.87-121.38), multiple birth (OR 6.62, 4.00-10.95), a relative with cerebral palsy (OR 1.61, 1.12-2.32), breech position (13.7\% patients compared with 6.0\% controls; OR 2.48, 1.76-3.49), bleeding at any time in pregnancy (29.3\% patients compared with 16.9\% controls; OR 2.04, 1.61-2.58), male sex (58.8\% patients compared with 45.8\% controls; OR 1.68, 1.38-2.06), multiple miscarriage (7.7\% patients compared with 3.5\% controls; OR 2.30, 1.38-3.82), smoking (14.0\% patients compared with 10.6\% controls; OR 1.37, 1.02-1.85), and illicit drug use (3.3\% patients compared with 1.5\% controls; OR 2.22, 1.14-4.30). Factors not associated with cerebral palsy were "disappearing twin," diabetes, maternal body mass index, hypertension, alcohol consumption, anemia, maternal hypothyroidism, forceps or vacuum delivery, and maternal age.
CONCLUSION: Preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, perinatal infection, and multiple birth present the largest risks for a cerebral palsy outcome. Reassuringly, upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections during pregnancy were not associated with cerebral palsy.

This paper introduces negative controls to a broader audience and provides guidance on principled design and causal analysis based on a formal negative control framework. Recent Findings: We review and summarize causal and statistical assumptions, practical strategies, and validation criteria that can be combined with subject matter knowledge to perform negative control analyses. We also review existing statistical methodologies for detection, reduction, and correction of confounding bias, and briefly discuss recent advances towards nonparametric identification of causal effects in a double negative control design. Summary: There is great potential for valid and accurate causal inference leveraging contemporary healthcare data in which negative controls are routinely available. Design and analysis of observational data leveraging negative controls is an area of growing interest in health and social sciences. Despite these developments, further effort is needed to disseminate these novel methods to ensure they are adopted by practicing epidemiologists.},

The problem arises when the addition of a variable to a regression equation produces an unintended discrepancy between the regression coeﬃcient and the eﬀect that the coeﬃcient is expected to represent. Avoiding such discrepancies presents a challenge not only to practitioners of econometrics, but to all analysts in the data intensive sciences. This note describes graphical tools for understanding, visualizing, and resolving the problem through a series of illustrative examples. We have found that the examples presented here can serve as a powerful instructional device to supplement formal discussions of the problem. By making this “crash course” accessible to instructors and practitioners, we hope to avail these tools to a broader community of scientists concerned with the causal interpretation of regression models.},

	abstract = {Epidemiologists are increasingly encountering complex longitudinal data, in which exposures and their confounders vary during follow-up. When a prior exposure affects the confounders of the subsequent exposures, estimating the effects of the time-varying exposures requires special statistical techniques, possibly with structural (i.e., counterfactual) models for targeted effects, even if all confounders are accurately measured. Among the methods used to estimate such effects, which can be cast as a marginal structural model in a straightforward way, one popular approach is inverse probability weighting. Despite the seemingly intuitive theory and easy-to-implement software, misunderstandings (or “pitfalls”) remain. For example, one may mistakenly equate marginal structural models with inverse probability weighting, failing to distinguish a marginal structural model encoding the causal parameters of interest from a nuisance model for exposure probability, and thereby failing to separate the problems of variable selection and model specification for these distinct models. Assuming the causal parameters of interest are identified given the study design and measurements, we provide a step-by-step illustration of generalized computation of standardization (called the g-formula) and inverse probability weighting, as well as the specification of marginal structural models, particularly for time-varying exposures. We use a novel hypothetical example, which allows us access to typically hidden potential outcomes. This illustration provides steppingstones (or “tips”) to understand more concretely the estimation of the effects of complex time-varying exposures.},

	abstract = {Background: 
        Randomized trials may have different effects in different settings. Moving to Opportunity (MTO), a housing experiment, is one such example. Previously, we examined the extent to which MTO’s overall effects on adolescent substance use and mental health outcomes were transportable across the sites to disentangle the contributions of differences in population composition versus differences in contextual factors to site differences. However, to further understand reasons for different site effects, it may be beneficial to examine mediation mechanisms and the degree to which they too are transportable across sites.
        Methods: 
        We used longitudinal data from MTO youth. We examined mediators summarizing aspects of the school environment over the 10–15 year follow-up. Outcomes of past-year substance use, mental health, and risk behavior were assessed at the final timepoint when participants were 10–20 years old. We used doubly robust and efficient substitution estimators to estimate (1) indirect effects by MTO site and (2) transported indirect effects from one site to another.
        Results: 
        Differences in indirect effect estimates were most pronounced between Chicago and Los Angeles. Using transport estimators to account for differences in baseline covariates, likelihood of using the voucher to move, and mediator distributions partially to fully accounted for site differences in indirect effect estimates in 10 of the 12 pathways examined.
        Conclusions: 
        Using transport estimators can provide an evidence-based approach for understanding the extent to which differences in compositional factors contribute to differences in indirect effect estimates across sites, and ultimately, to understanding why interventions may have different effects when applied to new populations.},

	doi = {10.1097/EDE.0000000000001211},
	abstract = {Background: 
        There was a distinct rise in mean birthweights in Norway starting in 1991 that plateaued in 1996–2002 and then declined to previous levels. We investigated whether these changes corresponded to trends in neonatal mortality or other birthweight-associated pregnancy outcomes. We also explored known predictors of birthweight and examined whether these could explain the birthweight trends.
        Methods: 
        We calculated mean birthweight for all live births in Norway in each year from 1982 to 2016, together with annual neonatal mortality and proportion of infants born preterm, or with low Apgar score. We stratified mean birthweight over time by factors including parity, gestational age, and Scandinavian versus non-Scandinavian origin of mother, to test robustness of the pattern. In addition, we used multivariable linear regression to obtain adjusted estimates for mean birthweight per year.
        Results: 
        A 50-g rise and fall of mean birthweights during a 25-year period was not accompanied by corresponding changes in neonatal mortality, preterm births, or Apgar scores. The distinct hump pattern was restricted to term births and was not apparent among infants of mothers born outside Scandinavia. We saw a similar pattern for Sweden but not Finland. Known predictors of birthweight (such as parity, mode of onset of delivery, and marital status) did not explain the hump.
        Conclusions: 
        A distinct temporal hump in mean birthweight among Norwegian term births had no obvious explanations. Furthermore, these fluctuations in birthweight were not associated indirectly with adverse outcomes in measures of infant health.},

The aim of this study was to establish the median diagnostic age of CP and to identify predictors of an early diagnosis in a population-based cohort. Method Using the Danish National Cerebral Palsy Registry (NCPR), we identified 1291 children with CP (764 males, 527 females) born between 1995 and 2003. The date of diagnosis was defined as the day the parents were told that their child was spastic or had CP. We calculated the age of diagnosis and analysed the following predictors: type of CP, degree of motor disability, cerebral ultrasonography results, epilepsy, gestational age, and degree of cognitive impairment. Results We found the overall median corrected diagnostic age of CP to be 11 months. Early diagnosis was associated with the type of CP, presence of epilepsy, a high degree of motor disability, and abnormalities in the cerebral ultrasonography. The gestational age was not associated with the diagnostic age. Interpretation The median diagnostic age implies that half of the Danish children with CP will be able to enter an early intervention program before 1 year of age. A late diagnosis was associated with less severe symptoms, and gestational age did not influence the diagnostic age.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence, subtypes, severity and neuroimaging findings of cerebral palsy (CP) in a cohort of children born in Southern Denmark. Risk factors were analysed and aetiology considered.
METHODS: A population-based cohort study covering 17,580 live births from 2003 to 2008.
RESULTS: The study included 43 children diagnosed with CP. The overall prevalence of CP was 2.4 per 1,000 live births (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.8-3.2). The gestational age (GA)-specific prevalence ranged from 63.5 per 1,000 live births for GA {\textless} 32 weeks to 1.3 for GA ≥ 37 weeks. Almost half of the children were born preterm and 28\% were from multiple pregnancies. The prevalence of CP was 1.8 per 1,000 in singletons and 15.4 per 1,000 in multiples. Low GA and birth weight were risk factors for CP, also after stratification for multiple births. Spastic CP was the predominating subtype of CP, and 24 children (56\%) were able to walk independently. White-matter lesions were the most common magnetic resonance imaging finding, and the aetiology of CP was known in 37\% of cases.
CONCLUSION: The overall prevalence of CP was slightly higher than that found in other Scandinavian studies due to its higher prevalence in the preterm group. Possible explanations include the high rate of multiple births in the background population. Neuroimaging findings were abnormal in the majority of children with CP, but aetiology could only be established in one third of the children. Primary prevention of CP is possible if the numbers of preterm births and multiple pregnancies can be reduced.

	abstract = {Background Cerebral palsy (CP) is a common motor disability in childhood. We examined the association between maternal infections during pregnancy and the risk of congenital CP in the child. Methods Liveborn singletons in Denmark between 1997 and 2003 were identified from the Danish National Birth Registry and followed from 1 year of life until 2008. Redemption of antibiotics from the National Register of Medicinal Product Statistics and maternal infections reported by the National Hospital Register were used as markers of maternal infection during pregnancy. CP diagnoses were obtained from the Danish Cerebral Palsy Registry. Adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) were estimated by Cox proportional hazard models. Results Of the 440 564 singletons with follow-up data, 840 were diagnosed with congenital CP. Maternal genito-urinary tract infections (HR 2.1, 95\% CI 1.4, 3.2) were associated with CP in all births, in term births (HR 1.9, 95\% CI 1.1, 3.2), in children with spastic CP (HR 2.1, 95\% CI 1.4, 3.3), and among first-born children (HR 1.9, 95\% CI 1.4, 3.3). Overall, we found associations between redeemed nitrofurantoin (HR 1.7, 95\% CI 1.1, 2.8) and CP. Among trimester-specific exposures, CP risk was associated with prescriptions redeemed in the first trimester for any antibacterials, beta-lactam antibacterials, and nitrofurantoin, an antibiotic commonly used to treat lower urinary tract infection, and genito-urinary tract infections in the third trimester. Conclusion Genito-urinary tract infections and antibiotic use during pregnancy were associated with increased risks of CP, indicating that some maternal infections or causes of maternal infections present in prenatal life may be part of a causal pathway leading to CP.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE. Our aim was to assess the incidence of cerebral palsy among children conceived with in vitro fertilization and children conceived without in vitro fertilization.
METHODS. A population-based, cohort study, including all live-born singletons and twins born in Denmark between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2000, was performed. Children conceived with in vitro fertilization (9255 children) were identified through the In Vitro Fertilization Register; children conceived without in vitro fertilization (394713) were identified through the Danish Medical Birth Register. Cerebral palsy diagnoses were obtained from the National Register of Hospital Discharges. The main outcome measure was the incidence of cerebral palsy in the in vitro fertilization and non-in vitro fertilization groups.
RESULTS. Children born after in vitro fertilization had an increased risk of cerebral palsy; these results were largely unchanged after adjustment for maternal age, gender, parity, small-for-gestational age status, and educational level. The independent effect of in vitro fertilization vanished after additional adjustment for multiplicity or preterm delivery. When both multiplicity and preterm delivery were included in the multivariate models, preterm delivery remained associated strongly with the risk of cerebral palsy.
CONCLUSIONS. The large proportions of preterm deliveries with in vitro fertilization, primarily for twins but also for singletons, pose an increased risk of cerebral palsy.},

	abstract = {Aim To analyse the social situation of parents who have a child with cerebral palsy (CP). Method This was a population-based longitudinal study with linkage to public registries. Parents of children with CP (n=3671) identified in the Danish CP Registry were compared with 17 983 parents of children without CP. Employment, income, cohabitation status, and presence of additional children were factors analysed during a follow-up period of 28 years. We followed parents from before their child was born and up to the age of 43 years of the child. Results Mothers of children with CP under the age of 10 were less often employed: odds ratio [OR] of employment at age 5y 0.45 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.36–0.57), but only 11\% left the labour market. Mothers of children without CP had higher incomes: ratio full-time working 1.11 (95\% CI 1.07–1.15). The risk of not living together was not increased among parents of children with CP: at age 5 years OR 1.04 (95\% CI 0.84–1.28). Parents of children with CP as the first born postponed or more seldom had subsequent children: hazard ratio [HR] 0.75 (95\% CI 0.68–0.83). Interpretation The Danish welfare system seems to have succeeded in keeping parents in the labour market and living together with their child. Special attention needs to be paid to the financial situation of families with children with CP under 10 years of age.},

Study Design We identified all live-born singletons born in Denmark between 1995 and 2003 and followed them from 1 year of age until December 31st, 2008. Information on four indices of fetal growth: ponderal index, head circumference/ abdominal circumference ratio, cephalization index and birth weight/ placenta weight ratio was collected. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI). All measurements were evaluated as gestational age and sex specific z-scores and in z-score percentile groups, adjusted for potential confounders, and stratified on gestational age groups ({\textless}32, 32-36, 37-38, 39, 40, ≥41 weeks). Results We identified 503,784 singleton births, of which 983 were confirmed cases of CP. Head/ abdominal circumference ratio (aHR:1.12; 95\%CI:1.07-1.16) and cephalization index (aHR:1.14; 95\%CI:1.11-1.16) were associated with the risk of CP irrespective of gestational age. Birth weight-placental weight ratio was also associated with CP in the entire cohort (aHR:0.90; 95\%CI:0.83-0.97). Ponderal index had a u-shaped association with CP, where both children with low and high ponderal index were at higher risk of CP. Conclusions CP is associated with disproportions between birth weight, birth length, placental weight and head circumference suggesting pre and perinatal conditions contribute to fetal growth restriction in children with CP.},

Although migraine often improves during pregnancy, the risk of adverse pregnancy, birth, neonatal, and neurological outcomes in mother and offspring remains poorly understood. Objective To investigate the associations between maternal migraine and risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes in the mother, and birth, neonatal and postnatal outcomes in the offspring. Methods We used Danish population registries to assemble a cohort of pregnancies among women with migraine and an age- and conception year-matched comparison cohort of pregnancies among women without migraine. The study period was 2005-2012. We computed adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) for pregnancy and birth outcomes and adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) for neonatal and postnatal outcomes, adjusting for age, preconception medical history, and preconception reproductive history. Results We identified 22,841 pregnancies among women with migraine and 228,324 matched pregnancies among women without migraine. Migraine was associated with an increased risk of pregnancy-associated hypertension disorders (aPR: 1.50 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.39-1.61]) and miscarriage (aPR: 1.10 [95\% CI: 1.05-1.15]). Migraine was associated with an increased prevalence of low birth weight (aPR: 1.14 [95\% CI: 1.06-1.23]), preterm birth (aPR: 1.21 [95\% CI: 1.13-1.30]) and cesarean delivery (aPR: 1.20 [95\% CI: 1.15-1.25]), but not of small for gestational age offspring (aPR: 0.94 [95\% CI: 0.88-0.99]) and birth defects (aPR: 1.01 [95\% CI: 0.93-1.09]). Offspring prenatally exposed to maternal migraine had elevated risks of several outcomes in the neonatal and postnatal period, including intensive care unit admission (aRR: 1.22 [95\% CI: 1.03-1.45]), hospitalization (aRR: 1.12 [95\% CI: 1.06-1.18]), dispensed prescriptions (aRR: 1.34 [95\% CI: 1.24-1.45]), respiratory distress syndrome (aRR: 1.20 [95\% CI: 1.02-1.42]), and febrile seizures (aRR: 1.27 [95\% CI: 1.03-1.57), but not of death (aRR: 0.67 [95\% CI: 0.43-1.04]) and cerebral palsy (aRR: 1.00 [95\% CI: 0.51-1.94]).

	abstract = {Objectives: 
        Exposure to prenatal stress may affect neurodevelopment of the fetus, but whether this exposure increases the risk of cerebral palsy (CP) later in life is unknown. We aimed to examine the association between maternal bereavement during the prenatal time period and CP in childhood.
        Methods: 
        We conducted a nationwide cohort study by linking information from nationwide registers. All 1,501,894 singletons born in Denmark from 1979 to 2004 were followed up from birth to the end of 2006. We identified 39,601 children whose mothers lost a close relative (child, spouse, parent, sibling) during pregnancy or up to 1 year before pregnancy and they were classified as the exposed group. The outcome of interest was the diagnosis of CP as registered in the National Hospital Register. We used Cox Regression to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs).
        Results: 
        Exposure to maternal bereavement after the loss of a child during the prenatal period was associated with an increased risk of CP among children born preterm without intrauterine growth retardation (HR 2.26, 95\% CI, 1.09–3.79) and among children born at term with intrauterine growth retardation (HR 2.01, 95\% CI, 1.04–3.89). Prenatal stress after maternal bereavement by loss of other relatives was not associated with an increased risk of CP.
        Conclusions: 
        Our data suggest that extremely severe stress in prenatal life could increase the susceptibility for CP among children born preterm or with impaired fetal growth.

	abstract = {Purpose Patients with epilepsy are at increased risk of premature death from all causes and likely also from sudden unexplained death (SUD). Many patients with epilepsy have significant comorbidity, and it is unclear how much of the increased risk can be explained by epilepsy itself. We aimed to chart the incidence of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) and estimate the risk of death from all causes and SUD conferred by epilepsy independently. Methods We conducted a historical cohort study using data from Danish registries and a complete manual review of all death certificates. The population studied consisted of all Danish residents in the age group 1–35 years, in the period 2000–2006 (inclusive), and the main outcome measures were risk of death and SUD. Key Findings We identified 33,022 subjects with epilepsy (median follow-up 3.7 years) and 3,001,952 subjects without (median follow-up 7.0 years). Among 685 deaths in the population with epilepsy, we identified 50 cases of definite and probable SUDEP corresponding to an incidence rate of 41.1 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 31.6–54.9) per 100,000 person-years. Incidence rates increased with age from 17.6 (95\% CI 9.5–32.8) in the age group 1–18 years to 73.8 (95\% CI 52.5–103.8) for the age group 24–35 years. Having epilepsy increased the crude risk of death with a hazard ratio (HR) of 11.9 (95\% CI 11.0–12.9). When adjusting for sex and comorbidities often encountered in patients with epilepsy (neurologic disease including cerebral palsy, psychiatric disease including mental retardation, and congenital disorders), as well as the Charlson comorbidity score, the HR fell to 5.4 (95\% CI 4.9–6.0). The crude HR for SUD was 27.5 (95\% CI 18.1–41.8) and fell to 16.3 (95\% CI 9.8–26.9) when adjusted for the same covariates as above. Significance Epilepsy in and of itself carries a significant risk of premature death and SUD. These findings highlight the potential gains of risk factor modification for the prevention of premature death and SUDEP in patients with epilepsy.},

	abstract = {Information bias occurs when any information used in a study is either measured or recorded inaccurately. This paper describes some of the most common types of information bias, using examples from obstetrics and gynecology, and describes how information bias may affect results of observational studies. Non-differential misclassification occurs when the degree of misclassification of exposure status among those with and those without the disease is the same; in cohort studies, this type of bias is most likely and will bias estimates toward no association when exposure is dichotomized. Non-differential underreporting of an exposure with more than two categories may mask a true threshold effect as a dose-response relation and, if a true threshold effect exists, the threshold will be set at too low a level, if the exposure is underreported. Differential misclassification may cause bias in either direction and is particularly likely, when exposure status is reported after the outcome occurred. Misclassification of confounders is an issue that needs special attention by researchers, as failure to measure accurately one or more (strong) confounders may seriously bias the observed results. Misclassification of disease status may also cause bias of estimates of association in either direction. Information bias is probably best prevented during planning of data collection, as there are few and insufficient methods available for correcting inaccurate information.},

	abstract = {Epidemiologists are often confronted with datasets to analyse which contain measurement error due to, for instance, mistaken data entries, inaccurate recordings and measurement instrument or procedural errors. If the effect of measurement error is misjudged, the data analyses are hampered and the validity of the study’s inferences may be affected. In this paper, we describe ﬁve myths that contribute to misjudgments about measurement error, regarding expected structure, impact and solutions to mitigate the problems resulting from mismeasurements. The aim is to clarify these measurement error misconceptions. We show that the inﬂuence of measurement error in an epidemiological data analysis can play out in ways that go beyond simple heuristics, such as heuristics about whether or not to expect attenuation of the effect estimates. Whereas we encourage epidemiologists to deliberate about the structure and potential impact of measurement error in their analyses, we also recommend exercising restraint when making claims about the magnitude or even direction of effect of measurement error if not accompanied by statistical measurement error corrections or quantitative bias analysis. Suggestions for alleviating the problems or investigating the structure and magnitude of measurement error are given.},

	abstract = {Information about the performance of diagnostic tests is typically presented in the form of measures of test accuracy such as sensitivity and specificity. These measures may be difficult to translate directly into decisions about patient treatment, for which information presented in the form of probabilities of disease after a positive or a negative test result may be more useful. These probabilities depend on the prevalence of the disease, which is likely to vary between populations. This article aims to clarify the relationship between pre-test (prevalence) and post-test probabilities of disease, and presents two free, online interactive tools to illustrate this relationship. These tools allow probabilities of disease to be compared with decision thresholds above and below which different treatment decisions may be indicated. They are intended to help those involved in communicating information about diagnostic test performance and are likely to be of benefit when teaching these concepts. A substantive example is presented using C reactive protein as a diagnostic marker for bacterial infection in the older adult population. The tools may also be useful for manufacturers of clinical tests in planning product development, for authors of test evaluation studies to improve reporting and for users of test evaluations to facilitate interpretation and application of the results.},

The association between the number of comorbid mental disorders (divided into categories of persons with ≥1 type of disorder, ≥2 types of disorders, ≥3 types of disorders, and ≥4 types of disorders) and LYL estimates was also examined.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}A total of 6 989 627 individuals (3 481 219 male persons [49.8\%] and 3 508 408 female persons [50.2\%]; mean [SD] age at study enrollment, 32.2 [24.4] years) were followed up for a total of 85 911 461 person-years. The YLL rates per 100 000 person-years were highest for alcohol use disorder (for male individuals, 568.7 [95\% CI, 564.4-572.7]; for female individuals, 155.5 [95\% CI, 153.5-157.9]) and suicide (for male individuals, 590.1 [95\% CI, 583.8-596.5]; for female individuals, 202.3 [95\% CI, 198.5-206.4]).

This finding provides a foundation for future intervention programs designed to reduce the differential mortality gap associated with mental disorders.

Compared with YLL, the novel LYL measurement approach may more precisely capture the association of mental disorders with premature mortality and facilitates the exploration of comorbidity and specific causes of death in individuals with mental disorders.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The nature and prevalence of combinations of mental disorders and their associations with premature mortality have never been reported in a comprehensive way. We describe the most common combinations of mental disorders and estimate excess mortality associated with these combinations. We designed a population-based cohort study including all 7,505,576 persons living in Denmark at some point between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2016. Information on mental disorders and mortality was obtained from national registers. A total of 546,090 individuals (10.5\%) living in Denmark on January 1, 1995 were diagnosed with at least one mental disorder during the 22-year follow-up period. The overall crude rate of diagnosis of mental disorders was 9.28 (95\% CI: 9.26-9.30) per 1,000 person-years. The rate of diagnosis of additional mental disorders was 70.01 (95\% CI: 69.80-70.26) per 1,000 person-years for individuals with one disorder already diagnosed. At the end of follow-up, two out of five individuals with mental disorders were diagnosed with two or more disorder types. The most prevalent were neurotic/stress-related/somatoform disorders (ICD-10 F40-F48) and mood disorders (ICD-10 F30-F39), which – alone or in combination with other disorders – were present in 64.8\% of individuals diagnosed with any mental disorder. Mortality rates were higher for people with mental disorders compared to those without mental disorders. The highest mortality rate ratio was 5.97 (95\% CI: 5.52-6.45) for the combination of schizophrenia (ICD-10 F20-F29), neurotic/stress-related/somatoform disorders and substance use disorders (ICD-10 F10-F19). Any combination of mental disorders was associated with a shorter life expectancy compared to the general Danish population, with differences in remaining life expectancy ranging from 5.06 years (95\% CI: 5.01-5.11) to 17.46 years (95\% CI: 16.86-18.03). The largest excess mortality was observed for combinations that included substance use disorders. This study reports novel estimates related to the “force of comorbidity” and provides new insights into the contribution of substance use disorders to premature mortality in those with comorbid mental disorders.},

We describe examples of selection bias in case control studies (eg, inappropriate selection of controls) and cohort studies (eg, informative censoring).

This structure is shared by other biases (eg, adjustment for variables affected by prior exposure). A structural classification of bias distinguishes between biases result ing from conditioning on common effects ("selection bias") and those resulting from the existence of common causes of exposure and outcome ("confounding"). This classification also leads to a unified approach to adjust for selection bias.},

We first phrase relevant causal questions and make a case for being specific about the possible exposure levels involved and the populations for which the question is relevant. Using the potential outcomes framework, we describe principled definitions of causal effects and of estimation approaches classified according to whether they invoke the no unmeasured confounding assumption (including outcome regression and propensity score-based methods) or an instrumental variable with added assumptions. We mainly focus on continuous outcomes and causal average treatment effects. We discuss interpretation, challenges, and potential pitfalls and illustrate application using a “simulation learner,” that mimics the effect of various breastfeeding interventions on a child's later development. This involves a typical simulation component with generated exposure, covariate, and outcome data inspired by a randomized intervention study. The simulation learner further generates various (linked) exposure types with a set of possible values per observation unit, from which observed as well as potential outcome data are generated. It thus provides true values of several causal effects. R code for data generation and analysis is available on www.ofcaus.org, where SAS and Stata code for analysis is also provided.},

	abstract = {Objective:
To assess whether first-trimester exposure to pregabalin is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, as recently suggested in a pregnancy registry study.

Methods:
We performed a cohort study nested in the US Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX). The study population included 1,323,432 pregnancies resulting in a live-born infant between 2000 and 2010. We examined the risk of major congenital malformations among infants born to women exposed to pregabalin during the first trimester compared with women unexposed to anticonvulsants. We used propensity score fine stratification to control for {\textgreater}50 potential confounders, and we estimated relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) in generalized linear models. The analyses were replicated in the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Database (MarketScan). Pooled estimates based on the adjusted RR produced in MAX, MarketScan, and the previous registry study were calculated.

Results:
Of 477 infants exposed to pregabalin during the first trimester in MAX, 28 (5.9\%) had malformations compared to 3.3\% in nonexposed infants. The crude RR of major congenital malformations for pregabalin was 1.80 (95\% CI 1.26–2.58). After propensity score adjustment, the RR moved to 1.16 (95\% CI 0.81–1.67). Restriction to pregabalin monotherapy and sensitivity analyses produced similar results. The adjusted RR for major congenital malformations for the 174 infants exposed in MarketScan was 1.03 (95\% CI 0.56–1.90). The pooled RR was 1.33 (95\% CI 0.83–2.15) for pregabalin any use and 1.02 (95\% CI 0.69–1.51) for pregabalin monotherapy.

Conclusions:
Findings did not confirm the suggested teratogenic effects of pregabalin, although they cannot rule out the possibility of a small effect.},

To examine the association between first-trimester angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor exposure and the risk for overall major congenital, cardiac, and central nervous system (CNS) malformations.

Methods
We used a cohort of completed pregnancies linked to liveborn infants derived from Medicaid claims from 2000 to 2010. We examined the risk of malformations associated with first-trimester exposure to an ACE inhibitor. Propensity score based methods were used to control for potential confounders including maternal demographics, medical conditions, exposure to other medications, and measures of health care utilization.

Results
The cohort included 1,333,624 pregnancies, of which 4,107 (0.31\%) were exposed to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester. The prevalence of overall malformations in the ACE inhibitor–exposed was 5.9\% versus 3.3\% in the unexposed (unadjusted relative risk (RR), 1.82; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.61 to 2.06), of cardiac malformations was 3.4\% versus 1.2\% (RR 2.95; 95\% CI 2.50 to 3.47), and of CNS malformations was 0.27\% versus 0.18\% (RR 1.46; 95\% CI 0.81 to 2.64). After restricting the cohort to pregnancies complicated by chronic hypertension (both exposed and unexposed) and accounting for other confounding factors, there was no significant increase in the risk for any of the outcomes assessed. Relative risks associated with first-trimester ACE inhibitor exposure were 0.89 (95\% CI 0.75 to 1.06) for overall malformations, 0.95 (95\% CI 0.75 to 1.21) for cardiac malformations, and 0.54 (95\% CI 0.26 to 1.11) for CNS malformations.

Conclusions
After accounting for confounders, among women with hypertension, exposure to ACE inhibitors during the first trimester was not associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
β blockers are widely used in the treatment of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy. These medications cross the placenta and may cause physiologic changes in neonates exposed in utero. We sought to define the risks of neonatal hypoglycemia and bradycardia associated with maternal exposure to β blockers at the time of delivery in a large, nationwide cohort of Medicaid beneficiaries.

METHODS:
We used a cohort of 2 292 116 completed pregnancies linked to liveborn infants of Medicaid-enrolled women from 2003 to 2007. We examined the risks of neonatal hypoglycemia and neonatal bradycardia associated with maternal exposure to β blockers at the time of delivery. Propensity score matching was used to control for potential confounders including maternal demographics, obstetric and medical conditions, and exposure to other medications.

RESULTS:
There were 10 585 (0.5\%) pregnancies exposed to β blockers at the time of delivery. The risk of neonatal hypoglycemia was 4.3\% in the β blocker–exposed neonates versus 1.2\% in the unexposed; the risk of neonatal bradycardia was 1.6\% in the exposed versus 0.5\% in the unexposed. After controlling for confounders, risk remained elevated for both neonatal hypoglycemia and bradycardia among exposed pregnancies versus unexposed (adjusted odds ratio, 1.68, 95\% confidence interval, 1.50–1.89 and adjusted odds ratio, 1.29, 95\% confidence interval, 1.07–1.55, respectively).

CONCLUSION
Our findings suggest that neonates born to mothers exposed to β blockers in late pregnancy, including labetalol, are at elevated risk for neonatal hypoglycemia and bradycardia.},

Design Population based cohort study.
Setting A cohort of pregnancies publicly insured in the United States, with data from the nationwide Medicaid Analytic eXtract 2000-14.
Participants Pregnancies of women enrolled in Medicaid from three or more months before the last menstrual period to one month after delivery, and infants enrolled for three or more months after birth.
Interventions Use of fluconazole and topical azoles was established by requiring one or more prescriptions during the first trimester of pregnancy.
Main outcome measures Risk of musculoskeletal malformations, conotruncal malformations, and oral clefts (primary outcomes), associated with exposure to oral fluconazole, diagnosed during the first 90 days after delivery, were examined.
Results The study cohort of 1 969 954 pregnancies included 37 650 (1.9\%) pregnancies exposed to oral fluconazole and 82 090 (4.2\%) pregnancies exposed to topical azoles during the first trimester. The risk of musculoskeletal malformations was 52.1 (95\% confidence interval 44.8 to 59.3) per 10 000 pregnancies exposed to fluconazole versus 37.3 (33.1 to 41.4) per 10 000 pregnancies exposed to topical azoles. The risks of conotruncal malformations were 9.6 (6.4 to 12.7) versus 8.3 (6.3 to 10.3) per 10 000 pregnancies exposed to fluconazole and topical azoles, respectively; risks of oral clefts were 9.3 (6.2 to 12.4) versus 10.6 (8.4 to 12.8) per 10 000 pregnancies, respectively. The adjusted relative risk after fine stratification of the propensity score was 1.30 (1.09 to 1.56) for musculoskeletal malformations, 1.04 (0.70 to 1.55) for conotruncal malformations, and 0.91 (0.61 to 1.35) for oral clefts overall. Based on cumulative doses of fluconazole, the adjusted relative risks for musculoskeletal malformations, conotruncal malformations, and oral clefts overall were 1.29 (1.05 to 1.58), 1.12 (0.71 to 1.77), and 0.88 (0.55 to 1.40) for 150 mg of fluconazole; 1.24 (0.93 to 1.66), 0.61 (0.26 to 1.39), and 1.08 (0.58 to 2.04) for more than 150 mg up to 450 mg of fluconazole; and 1.98 (1.23 to 3.17), 2.30 (0.93 to 5.65), and 0.94 (0.23 to 3.82) for more than 450 mg of fluconazole, respectively.
Conclusions Oral fluconazole use in the first trimester was not associated with oral clefts or conotruncal malformations, but an association with musculoskeletal malformations was found, corresponding to a small adjusted risk difference of about 12 incidents per 10 000 exposed pregnancies overall.},

Design Observational cohort study.
Setting Medicaid data from 46 US states.
Participants Pregnant women filling at least one prescription for an opioid analgesic at any time during pregnancy for whom opioid exposure characteristics including duration of therapy: short term ({\textless}30 days) or long term (≥30 days); timing of use: early use (only in the first two trimesters) or late use (extending into the third trimester); and cumulative dose (in morphine equivalent milligrams) were assessed.
Main outcome measure Diagnosis of NAS in liveborn infants.
Results 1705 cases of NAS were identified among 290 605 pregnant women filling opioid prescriptions, corresponding to an absolute risk of 5.9 per 1000 deliveries (95\% confidence interval 5.6 to 6.2). Long term opioid use during pregnancy resulted in higher absolute risk of NAS per 1000 deliveries in the presence of additional risk factors of known opioid misuse (220.2 (200.8 to 241.0)), alcohol or other drug misuse (30.8 (26.1 to 36.0)), exposure to other psychotropic medications (13.1 (10.6 to 16.1)), and smoking (6.6 (4.3 to 9.6)) than in the absence of any of these risk factors (4.2 (3.3 to 5.4)). The corresponding risk estimates for short term use were 192.0 (175.8 to 209.3), 7.0 (6.0 to 8.2), 2.0 (1.5 to 2.6), 1.5 (1.0 to 2.0), and 0.7 (0.6 to 0.8) per 1000 deliveries, respectively. In propensity score matched analyses, long term prescription opioid use compared with short term use and late use compared with early use in pregnancy demonstrated greater risk of NAS (risk ratios 2.05 (95\% confidence interval 1.81 to 2.33) and 1.24 (1.12 to 1.38), respectively).
Conclusions Use of prescription opioids during pregnancy is associated with a low absolute risk of NAS in the absence of additional risk factors. Long term use compared with short term use and late use compared with early use of prescription opioids are associated with increased NAS risk independent of additional risk factors.},

Design Cohort study.
Setting United States.
Participants A cohort of 886 996 completed pregnancies linked to liveborn infants of women enrolled in Medicaid from 2000 to 2007.
Methods We examined the risk of major congenital malformations and organ specific malformations in offspring associated with maternal use of a statin in the first trimester. Propensity score based methods were used to control for potential confounders, including maternal demographic characteristics, obstetric and medical conditions, and use of other drugs.
Results 1152 (0.13\%) women used a statin during the first trimester. In unadjusted analyses, the prevalence of malformations in the offspring of these women was 6.34\% compared with 3.55\% in those of women who did not use a statin in the first trimester (relative risk 1.79, 95\% confidence interval 1.43 to 2.23). Controlling for confounders, particularly pre-existing diabetes, accounted for this increase in risk (1.07, 0.85 to 1.37). There were also no statistically significant increases in any of the organ specific malformations assessed after accounting for confounders. Results were similar across a range of sensitivity analyses.
Conclusions Our analysis did not find a significant teratogenic effect from maternal use of statins in the first trimester. However, these findings need to be replicated in other large studies, and the long term effects of in utero exposure to statins needs to be assessed, before use of statins in pregnancy can be considered safe.},

	abstract = {Objective
              Diabetes in pregnancy and consequently the need for treatment with antidiabetic medication (ADM) has become increasingly prevalent. The prevalence and patterns of use of ADM in pregnancy from 2006 onward in seven different countries was assessed.
            
            
              Research design and methods
              Data sources included individually linked data from the nationwide health registers in Denmark (2006–2016), Finland (2006–2016), Iceland (2006–2012), Norway (2006–2015), Sweden (2006–2015), state-wide administrative and claims data for New South Wales, Australia (2006–2012) and two US insurance databases: Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX; 2006–2012, public) and IBM MarketScan (2012–2015, private). The prevalence of ADM use was calculated as the proportion of pregnancies with at least one filled prescription of an ADM in the 90 days before pregnancy or within the three trimesters of pregnancy.
            
            
              Results
              Prevalence of any ADM use in 5 279 231 pregnancies was 3\% (n=147 999) and varied from under 2\% (Denmark, Norway, and Sweden) to above 5\% (Australia and US). Insulin was the most used ADM, and metformin was the most used oral hypoglycemic agent with increasing use over time in all countries. In 11.4\%–62.5\% of pregnancies with prepregnancy use, ADM (primarily metformin) was discontinued. When ADM treatment was initiated in late pregnancy for treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus, insulin was most often dispensed, except in the US, where glibenclamide was most often used.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Prevalence and patterns of use of ADM classes varied between countries and over time. While insulin remained the most common ADM used in pregnancy, metformin use increased significantly over the study period.},

	doi = {10.1002/pds.2184},
	abstract = {Purpose
To review the literature describing patterns of out-patient prescription drug use during pregnancy by therapeutic category, potential for fetal harm, and overall.

Methods
We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature published from 1989 to 2010. We included studies evaluating individual-level exposures to prescription medicines during pregnancy. We selected only studies conducted in developed (OECD) countries and published in English.

Results
Published drug utilization studies reveal wide variation in estimates of overall prescription drug use in pregnancy (27\% to 93\% of pregnant women filling at least one prescription excluding vitamins and minerals). Among studies of similar design, estimates were lowest in Northern European countries (44\% to 47\%) and highest in France (93\%) and Germany (85\%). Measured rates of use of contraindicated medicines in pregnancy ranged from 0.9\% (Denmark; 1991–1996) to 4.6\% (USA; 1996–2000). The use of medicines with positive evidence of risk (FDA category D) ranged from 2.0\% (Italy; 2004) to 59.3\% (France; 1995–2001).

Conclusion
Avoidable inconsistencies in study design and reporting attenuate conclusions that can be drawn from the literature on antenatal drug utilization. Nevertheless, the body of published research shows that antenatal prescription drug use is common, with many studies finding that a majority of women use one or more prescription medicine during pregnancy. Similarly, studies consistently report the use of drugs recognized as having potential risks in pregnancy. Given this widespread use, it is particularly important to develop standards for calculating and reporting antenatal exposures to improve the value of future research in this area.},

	abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the effectiveness of methods that control for confounding by indication, we compared breast cancer recurrence rates among women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy versus those who did not.

Study Design and Setting
In a medical record review-based study of breast cancer treatment in older women (n=1798) diagnosed 1990-1994, our crude analysis suggested adjuvant chemotherapy was positively associated with recurrence [hazard ratio (HR)=2.6 (95\% confidence interval (CI)=1.9, 3.5)]. We expected a protective effect, so postulated that the crude association was confounded by indications for chemotherapy. We attempted to adjust for this confounding by restriction, multivariable regression, propensity scores [PS], and instrumental variable [IV] methods.

Results
After restricting to women at high-risk for recurrence (n=946), chemotherapy was not associated with recurrence [HR=1.1 (95\% CI=0.7, 1.6)] using multivariable regression. PS adjustment yielded similar results [HR=1.3 (95\% CI=0.8, 2.0)]. The IV-like method yielded a protective estimate [HR=0.9; (95\% CI=0.2, 4.3)]; however imbalances of measured factors across levels of the IV suggested residual confounding.

Conclusion
Conventional methods do not control for unmeasured factors, which often remain important when addressing confounding by indication. PS and IV analysis methods can be useful under specific situations, but neither method adequately controlled confounding by indication in this study.},

	abstract = {Background 
        Published epidemiologic research usually provides a quantitative assessment of random error for effect estimates, but no quantitative assessment of systematic error. Sensitivity analysis can provide such an assessment.
        Methods 
        We describe a method to reconstruct epidemiologic data, accounting for biases, and to display the results of repeated reconstructions as an assessment of error. We illustrate with a study of the effect of less-than-definitive therapy on breast cancer mortality.
        Results 
        We developed SAS code to reconstruct the data that would have been observed had a set of systematic errors been absent, and to convey the results. After 4,000 reconstructions of the example data, we obtained a median estimate of relative hazard equal to 1.5 with a 95\% simulation interval of 0.8-2.8. The relative hazard obtained by conventional analysis equaled 2.0, with a 95\% confidence interval of 1.2-3.4.
        Conclusions 
        Our method of sensitivity analysis can be used to quantify the systematic error for an estimate of effect and to describe that error in figures, tables, or text. In the example, the sources of error biased the conventional relative hazard away from the null, and that error was not accurately communicated by the conventional confidence interval.},

        Human data on the teratogenicity of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are limited. We examined the association between SSRI use during early pregnancy and the risk of congenital malformations in the offspring.
        Methods: 
        In a population-based cohort study from Denmark, we identified 1051 women who filled prescriptions for SSRIs from 30 days before conception to the end of the first trimester; of those, 453 filled the prescription during the second or third pregnancy month. We included 150,780 women with no SSRI prescriptions as a reference cohort. Drug use data were extracted from prescription databases. Data on congenital malformations and potential confounders were extracted from hospital discharge registries and the National Birth Registry.
        Results: 
        The 150,780 women with no SSRI prescriptions gave birth to 5112 (3.4\%) children with congenital malformations. The 1051 women with SSRI prescriptions any time during early pregnancy gave birth to 51 (4.9\%) children with congenital malformations. The corresponding adjusted relative risk (aRRs) was 1.34 (95\% confidence interval = 1.00–1.79). The 453 women with prescriptions during the second or third month of pregnancy gave birth to 31 (6.8\%) children with congenital malformations. The corresponding aRR was 1.84 (1.25–2.71).
        Conclusions: 
        We found an increased risk of congenital malformations after exposure to SSRIs in early pregnancy. It is unclear whether the effects were causal or due to factors related to the underlying disease. There was no evidence that the association was specific to particular malformations.},

	abstract = {More than half of all pregnant women take prescription medications, raising concerns about fetal safety. Medical databases routinely collecting data from large populations are potentially valuable resources for cohort studies addressing teratogenicity of drugs. These include electronic medical records, administrative databases, population health registries, and teratogenicity information services. Medical databases allow estimation of prevalences of birth defects with enhanced precision, but systematic error remains a potentially serious problem. In this review, we first provide a brief description of types of North American and European medical databases suitable for studying teratogenicity of drugs and then discuss manifestation of systematic errors in teratogenicity studies based on such databases. Selection bias stems primarily from the inability to ascertain all reproductive outcomes. Information bias (misclassification) may be caused by paucity of recorded clinical details or incomplete documentation of medication use. Confounding, particularly confounding by indication, can rarely be ruled out. Bias that either masks teratogenicity or creates false appearance thereof, may have adverse consequences for the health of the child and the mother. Biases should be quantified and their potential impact on the study results should be assessed. Both theory and software are available for such estimation. Provided that methodological problems are understood and effectively handled, computerized medical databases are a valuable source of data for studies of teratogenicity of drugs.},

	abstract = {Purpose:
To describe patterns of prescribed drug use over time among primiparous women in Denmark.

Methods:
Through the Danish Medical Birth Registry, we identified all primiparous women giving live birth or stillbirth at ≥ 22 gestational weeks in northern Denmark, from 1999 to 2009. From the Aarhus University Prescription Database we obtained information on the women’s prescriptions for reimbursed drugs filled from 30 days before conception until delivery.

Results:
Among 85,710 primiparous women, 47,982 (56.0\%) redeemed at least one prescription from 30 days before conception until delivery. Women aged 35 years and older had the highest overall prevalence of prescription drug use (61.1\%). Age-standardized prevalence of drug use was 54.7\% in 1999 and 61.2\% in 2009, prevalence ratio (PR) of 1.13 (95\% confidence interval 1.10; 1.16), adjusted for age and smoking.

Conclusion:
Over the 11-year period from 1999 to 2009, we found a modest increase in overall use of drugs by primiparous women in Denmark. This increase was not, however, explained by an increasing proportion of older first-time mothers. We noted changes in patterns of use of anti-infective drugs and antidepressants.},

	title = {Use of antiepileptic drugs in women of fertile age},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: We studied the use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in women of fertile age and pregnant women in a 16-year-period in Denmark.
METHODS: We included all women of fertile age (age 18-44 years) and pregnant women from 2001 to 2016 identified from Danish registers.
RESULTS: The median proportion of women of fertile age who took AEDs increased from 10.7‰ (95\% confidence interval (CI): 10.5-10.9‰) in 2001 to 27.1‰ (95\% CI: 26.827.4‰) in 2016. Lamotrigine, levetiracetam, gabapentin and pregabalin have been increasingly used over time and have been the main AEDs used in recent years. The use of valproate in women of fertile age decreased slightly from 2.1‰ (95\% CI: 2.0-2.2‰) to 1.9‰ (95\% CI: 1.8-2.0‰), which was explained by a decrease in the use after 2014 among women aged 18-24 years. The increased use of AEDs was likely owed to use for other indications than epilepsy. The overall use of AEDs in pregnant women increased from 3.8‰ (95\% CI: 3.3-4.3‰) in 2001 to 6.9‰ (95\% CI: 6.2-7.6‰) in 2016, and the use of valproate decreased from 0.6‰ (95\% CI: 0.4-0.8‰) in 2001 and to 0.2‰ (95\% CI: 0.1-0.4‰).
CONCLUSIONS: The overall use of AEDs in women of fertile age and pregnant women has increased in the past 16 years, especially due to an increased use of lamotrigine. However, valproate use in pregnant women and in younger women of fertile age has become less frequent. FUNDING: This study received funding from the Lundbeck Foundation, the Danish Epilepsy Association, the Central Denmark Region and the Novo Nordisk Foundation (NNF16OC0019126).

	doi = {10.1097/EE9.0000000000000085},
	abstract = {Background: 
        Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with negative health outcomes in both the short and long term. However, the cohort studies that have produced many of the estimates of long-term exposure associations may fail to account for selection bias in pollution exposure as well as covariate imbalance in the study population; therefore, causal modeling techniques may be beneficial.
        Methods: 
        Twenty-nine years of data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) was compiled and linked to modeled annual average outdoor PM2.5 concentration and restricted-use mortality data. A series of Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted using inverse probability weights, yielded causal risk estimates of long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 on all-cause and cardiopulmonary mortality.
        Results: 
        Covariate-adjusted estimated relative risks per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure were estimated to be 1.117 (1.083, 1.152) for all-cause mortality and 1.232 (1.174, 1.292) for cardiopulmonary mortality. Inverse probability weighted Cox models provide relatively consistent and robust estimates similar to those in the unweighted baseline multivariate Cox model, though they have marginally lower point estimates and higher standard errors.
        Conclusions: 
        These results provide evidence that long-term exposure to PM2.5 contributes to increased mortality risk in US adults and that the estimated effects are generally robust to modeling choices. The size and robustness of estimated associations highlight the importance of clean air as a matter of public health. Estimated confounding due to measured covariates appears minimal in the NHIS cohort, and various distributional assumptions have little bearing on the magnitude or standard errors of estimated causal associations.},

	abstract = {Right-truncated data arise when observations are ascertained retrospectively, and only subjects who experience the event of interest by the time of sampling are selected. Such a selection scheme, without adjustment, leads to biased estimation of covariate effects in the Cox proportional hazards model. The existing methods for fitting the Cox model to right-truncated data, which are based on the maximization of the likelihood or solving estimating equations with respect to both the baseline hazard function and the covariate effects, are numerically challenging. We consider two alternative simple methods based on inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimating equations, which allow consistent estimation of covariate effects under a positivity assumption and avoid estimation of baseline hazards. We discuss problems of identifiability and consistency that arise when positivity does not hold and show that although the partial tests for null effects based on these IPW methods can be used in some settings even in the absence of positivity, they are not valid in general. We propose adjusted estimating equations that incorporate the probability of observation when it is known from external sources, which results in consistent estimation. We compare the methods in simulations and apply them to the analyses of human immunodeficiency virus latency.},

In multi-site studies, it may be infeasible to pool individual-level datasets due to privacy and other considerations. We propose three methods for making inference on hazard ratios without the need for pooling individual-level datasets across sites. The first method requires a summary-level eight-column risk-set table to produce the same hazard ratio estimate and robust sandwich variance estimate as those from the corresponding pooled individual-level data analysis (reference analysis). The second and third methods, which are based on two bootstrap re-sampling strategies, require a summary-level four-column risk-set table and bootstrap-based risk-set tables from each site to produce the same hazard ratio and bootstrap variance estimates as those from their reference analyses. All three methods require only one file transfer between the data-contributing sites and the analysis center. We justify these methods theoretically, illustrate their use, and demonstrate their statistical performance using both simulated and real-world data.},

Understanding a study’s data generating structure and translating that data structure into a DAG can be challenging, but these skills are often glossed over in training. Campbell and Stanley’s framework for causal inference has been extraordinarily influential in social science training programs but has received less attention in epidemiology. Their work, along with subsequent revisions and enhancements based on practical experience conducting empirical studies, presents a catalog of 37 threats to validity describing reasons empirical studies may fail to deliver causal effects. We interpret most of these threats to study validity as suggestions for common causal structures. Threats are organized into issues of statistical conclusion validity, internal validity, construct validity, or external validity. To assist epidemiologists in drawing the correct DAG for their application, we map the correspondence between threats to validity and epidemiologic concepts that can be represented with DAGs. Representing these threats as DAGs makes them amenable to formal analysis with d-separation rules and breaks down cross-disciplinary language barriers in communicating methodologic issues.},

The difference in restricted mean survival times (RMSTs) up to a pre-specified time point is an alternative measure that offers a clinically meaningful interpretation. Several regression-based methods exist to estimate an adjusted difference in RMSTs, but they digress from the model-free method of taking the area under the survival function. We derive the adjusted RMST by integrating an adjusted Kaplan-Meier estimator with inverse probability weighting (IPW). The adjusted difference in RMSTs is the area between the two IPW-adjusted survival functions. In a Monte Carlo-type simulation study, we demonstrate that the proposed estimator performs as well as two regression-based approaches: the ANCOVA-type method of Tian et al and the pseudo-observation method of Andersen et al. We illustrate the methods by reexamining the association between total cholesterol and the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease in the Framingham Heart Study.},

A cohort of 123,322 children born in Denmark between 1964 and 2006 to 68,255 women who had been evaluated for infertility was established. We used a case–cohort design and calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for cancer in childhood (0–19 years) and in young adulthood (20–29 years) associated with maternal use of six groups of fertility drugs (clomiphene, gonadotropins [i.e., human menopausal gonadotropins and follicle-stimulating hormone], gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs, human chorionic gonadotropins, progesterone and other fertility drugs). We found no statistically significant association between maternal use of fertility drugs and risk for overall cancer in childhood or young adulthood. However, with regard to specific cancers in childhood, our results showed that maternal use of progesterone before childbirth markedly increased the risks of their offspring for acute lymphocytic leukemia (any use: HR, 4.95; 95\% CI, 1.69–14.54; ≥ three cycles of use: HR, 9.96; 95\% CI, 2.63–37.77) and for sympathetic nervous system tumors (any use: HR, 5.79; 95\% CI, 1.23–27.24; ≥ three cycles of use: HR, 8.51; 95\% CI, 1.72–42.19). These findings show that maternal use of progesterone may increase the risk for specific cancers in the offspring. Additional large epidemiological studies are urgently needed to confirm our finding.},

	volume = {29},
	issn = {1099-1557},
	doi = {10.1002/pds.5037},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: In contrast to randomized clinical trials, comparative safety and effectiveness assessments of osteoporosis medications in clinical practice may be subject to confounding by indication. We used negative control outcomes to detect residual confounding when comparing osteoporosis medications.
METHODS: Using MarketScan Commercial and Supplemental claims, we identified women aged ≥55 years who initiated an oral bisphosphonate (BP) (risedronate, alendronate, or ibandronate), denosumab (an injected biologic), or intravenous zoledronic acid (ZA) from October 1, 2010 to September 30, 2015. Women with Paget's disease or cancer were excluded. We compared individual oral BPs to each other, denosumab to ZA, denosumab to oral BPs, and ZA to oral BPs, with respect to 11 negative control outcomes identified by subject matter experts. We estimated the 12-month cumulative risk difference (RD) using inverse probability of treatment and censoring weights.
RESULTS: Among 148 587 women, most initiated alendronate (57\%), followed by ibandronate (12\%), ZA (11\%), risedronate (10\%), and denosumab (10\%). Compared with denosumab, patients initiating ZA had similar risks of all negative control outcomes. Compared with oral BPs, patients initiating denosumab had a higher risk of a wellness visit (RD = 1.2\%, 95\% CI: 0.4, 1.9) and a lower risk of receiving herpes zoster vaccine (RD = -0.6\%, 95\% CI: -1.1, -0.2). Comparing ZA with oral BP initiators resulted in two outcomes with positive associations.
CONCLUSIONS: Caution is warranted when comparing injectable vs oral osteoporosis medications, given the potential for unmeasured confounding. Evaluating negative control outcomes could be a standard validity check prior to conducting comparative studies.},

In this paper, we present a new maximum likelihood based estimator for marginal causal effects that simultaneously adjusts for confounding and several forms of joint misclassification of the exposure and outcome variables. The proposed method relies on validation data for the construction of weights that account for both sources of bias. The weighting estimator, which is an extension of the outcome misclassification weighting estimator proposed by Gravel and Platt (Weighted estimation for confounded binary outcomes subject to misclassification. Stat Med 2018; 37: 425–436), is applied to reinfarction data. Simulation studies were carried out to study its finite sample properties and compare it with methods that do not account for confounding or misclassification. The new estimator showed favourable large sample properties in the simulations. Further research is needed to study the sensitivity of the proposed method and that of alternatives to violations of their assumptions. The implementation of the estimator is facilitated by a new R function (ipwm) in an existing R package (mecor).},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0132280},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic medications are increasingly used during pregnancy. Nevertheless, fetal risks are still not fully studied. It is currently unclear whether the antipsychotic treatment might induce a higher risk of fetal death. We aimed to determine if use of antipsychotic medication during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion or stillbirth.
METHODS: In a historical cohort study, we identified all clinically recognized pregnancies registered in the nationwide Danish registries from 1997 to 2008 (N = 1,005,319). Exposure was defined as any prescription of antipsychotic medications redeemed by the pregnant women during the exposure window, and recorded in the Danish National Prescription Register. Outcome was defined as any spontaneous abortion or stillbirth recorded in the Danish National Hospital Register and the Danish Medical Birth Register respectively.
RESULTS: Women exposed to antipsychotic medications during pregnancy had a 34\% higher risk of spontaneous abortion (adjusted relative risk = 1.34; 95\% confidence interval = 1.22; 1.46) compared to unexposed women, but a similar risk compared to women exposed prior to (but not during) pregnancy (adjusted relative risk = 1.04; 95\% confidence interval = 0.93; 1.17). The risk of spontaneous abortion was not increased in exposed pregnancies when compared to unexposed pregnancies in the same women (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.11; 95\% CI = 0.94; 1.31). A twofold higher risk of stillbirth was found in women exposed to antipsychotic medications compared with unexposed women (relative risk = 2.27; 95\% confidence interval = 1.45; 3.55) and compared with women exposed only prior to pregnancy (relative risk = 2.06; 95\% confidence interval = 1.01; 4.19).
CONCLUSIONS: The increased risk of spontaneous abortion found in women treated with antipsychotic medications during pregnancy is most likely due to confounding factors. The risk of stillbirth was twofold higher in pregnancies exposed to antipsychotic medication during pregnancy. Treatment with antipsychotic medications during pregnancy requires careful consideration.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of pregnancy-associated cancer during a 30-year period in Denmark on the basis of both births and abortions with and without age adjustment and age standardization.
METHODS: Using data from the nationwide Danish registries, we investigated the occurrence of pregnancy-associated cancer (defined as cancer diagnosed during pregnancy and up to 1 year after pregnancy has ended) in pregnancies resulting in a birth (live birth or stillbirth) or an abortion. We included patients with primary cancer diagnosed at ages 15-44 years during 1977-2006 according to the Danish Cancer Registry. The patients were linked to the Medical Birth Registry, the Registry for Induced Abortions, and the National Patient Registry to obtain information on pregnancies.
RESULTS: We identified 2,426 patients with pregnancy-associated cancer. The three most frequent types were melanoma, cervical cancer, and breast cancer. We found an increase in the total numbers of all pregnancy-associated cancers from 572 cases during 1977-1986 to 1,052 cases during 1997-2006. The proportions of all pregnancy-associated cancers among all cancers increased from 5.4\% to 8.3\% during the same periods. The overall crude incidence rate of all pregnancy-associated cancer was 89.6 out of 100,000 pregnancies. The crude incidence increased over time, with an average annual percentage change of 2.9\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.4-3.3). After age adjustment, the increase was still statistically significant (1.6\%, 95\% CI 1.1-2.1).
CONCLUSION: We found a statistically significant increase in pregnancy-associated cancer during the 30-year study period. The tendency to postpone childbirth only partly explains the increase in incidence rates.

METHODS: A drug utilization study based on linked individual-level data from the nationwide prescription- and medical birth registers in Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. The study population comprised all pregnancies in these countries, resulting in a live birth or stillbirth after gestational week 22 from January 1st 2008 to December 31st 2012 (N = 1 162 470). In addition to the main study drugs SSRIs and SNRIs, we included (concurrent) use of other antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics and hypnotics.
RESULTS: A total of 38 219 (3.3\%) pregnancies were exposed to SSRIs and 5 634 (0.5\%) to SNRIs. Prevalence of SSRI and SNRI use varied by country (1.8\% in Norway to 7.0\% in Iceland). Use and prescribed dosages decreased with each passing trimester of pregnancy; prevalence was 2.7\% at conception, and 2.1\%, 1.7\% and 1.3\% respectively in 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester. In 0.6\% of pregnancies women filled a prescription before pregnancy and in every trimester. In one third of exposed pregnancies, women were also dispensed anxiolytics, hypnotics or sedatives.
CONCLUSION: Use of SSRI and SNRI use during pregnancy varied between the Nordic countries, but the overall prevalence remained low and relatively stable from 2008 to 2012. The low prevalence of use and high proportion of women who discontinue treatment in pregnancy raise questions about adequate treatment of depression in pregnant women.},

Some women will have inadvertent exposure to vaccination during early pregnancy, but few data exist regarding the safety of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in this context.
METHODS: We assessed a cohort that included all the women in Denmark who had a pregnancy ending between October 1, 2006, and November 30, 2013. Using nationwide registers, we linked information on vaccination, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and potential confounders among women in the cohort. Women who had vaccine exposure during the prespecified time windows were matched for propensity score in a 1:4 ratio with women who did not have vaccine exposure during the same time windows. Outcomes included spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, major birth defect, small size for gestational age, low birth weight, and preterm birth.
RESULTS: In matched analyses, exposure to the quadrivalent HPV vaccine was not associated with significantly higher risks than no exposure for major birth defect (65 cases among 1665 exposed pregnancies and 220 cases among 6660 unexposed pregnancies; prevalence odds ratio, 1.19; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.58), spontaneous abortion (20 cases among 463 exposed pregnancies and 131 cases among 1852 unexposed pregnancies; hazard ratio, 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.45 to 1.14), preterm birth (116 cases among 1774 exposed pregnancies and 407 cases among 7096 unexposed pregnancies; prevalence odds ratio, 1.15; 95\% CI, 0.93 to 1.42), low birth weight (76 cases among 1768 exposed pregnancies and 277 cases among 7072 unexposed pregnancies; prevalence odds ratio, 1.10; 95\% CI, 0.85 to 1.43), small size for gestational age (171 cases among 1768 exposed pregnancies and 783 cases among 7072 unexposed pregnancies; prevalence odds ratio, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.72 to 1.02), or stillbirth (2 cases among 501 exposed pregnancies and 4 cases among 2004 unexposed pregnancies; hazard ratio, 2.43; 95\% CI, 0.45 to 13.21).

METHODS: All women giving live birth between 1997 and 2011 in Denmark were included in this nationwide cohort study. All women redeeming at least one prescription of antazoline-naphazoline eye drops during the first 84 days of pregnancy were identified. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios of malformations among exposed offspring compared to non-exposed offspring.
RESULTS: We identified 977 706 births between 1997 and 2011. A total of 3061 women (0.32\%) were exposed to antazoline-naphazoline eye drops in the first trimester of pregnancy. The rate of congenital malformations was 3.0\% (n = 93) in exposed offspring and 3.5\% (n = 33 594) in unexposed offspring. First-trimester exposure to antazoline-naphazoline was not associated with major congenital malformations overall (odds ratio: 0.88, 95\% confidence interval: 0.71-1.09) or with any specific major malformation. The number of redeemed prescriptions was unchanged during all trimesters of pregnancy as compared to before and after pregnancy (p {\textless} 0.05).

METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study in Danish women, selecting live births and stillbirths (Birth Registry) and spontaneous abortions and induced terminations (Patient Registry). Montelukast exposure was obtained from the Prescription Registry (ATC code R03DC03). Exposure period was from 3 months before the last menstrual period until the end of the first trimester. Four groups were studied: (1) women with prescription for montelukast, (2) women with prescription for montelukast and other anti-asthmatic medications, (3) women with prescription for other anti-asthmatic medications, (4) women without prescription for any anti-asthmatic medications.
RESULTS: A total of 754,300 singleton pregnancies ({\textgreater} 12 weeks) were identified: 401 pregnancies in group 1, 426 pregnancies in group 2, 24878 in group 3 and 728,595 in group 4. Risk of preterm birth, maternal preeclampsia and gestational diabetes was increased for pregnancies exposed to montelukast. No significant differences were found for the risk of major congenital anomalies (CA). Adjusted odds ratio for CA was 1.4 (95\% CI 0.9-2.3) for the group 1 and 1.0 (95\% CI 0.6-1.8) for group 2.
CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with prescriptions for montelukast had a higher risk of preterm birth and maternal complications. These risks are known to be associated with maternal asthma, no increased risk of CA was found.

The effectiveness of these protective mechanisms in the embryo, fetus and newborn brain is less clear. The longstanding belief that "the" blood-brain barrier is absent or immature in the fetus and newborn has led to many misleading statements with potential clinical implications. Here we review the properties of brain barrier mechanisms in the context of drug entry into the developing brain and discuss the limited number of studies published on the subject. We noticed that most of available literature suffers from some experimental limitations, notably that drug levels in fetal blood and cerebrospinal fluid have not been measured. This means that the relative contribution to the overall brain protection provided by individual barriers such as the placenta (which contains similar efflux mechanisms) and the brain barriers cannot be separately ascertained. Finally, we propose that systematic studies in appropriate animal models of drug entry into the brain at different stages of development would provide a rational basis for use of medications in pregnancy and in newborns, especially prematurely born, where protection usually provided by the placenta is no longer present.},

	abstract = {Efflux mechanisms situated in various brain barrier interfaces control drug entry into the adult brain; this review considers the effectiveness of these protective mechanisms in the embryo, fetus, and newborn brain. The longstanding belief that the blood-brain barrier is absent or immature in the fetus and newborn has led to many misleading statements with potential clinical implications. The immature brain is undoubtedly more vulnerable to damage by drugs and toxins; as is reviewed here, some developmentally regulated normal brain barrier mechanisms probably contribute to this vulnerability. We propose that the functional status of brain barrier efflux mechanisms should be investigated at different stages of brain development to provide a rational basis for the use of drugs in pregnancy and in newborns, especially in those prematurely born, where protection usually provided by the placenta is no longer present.},

We aimed to examine whether treatment with anti-TNF-α during the third trimester affected preterm birth and low birth weight (LBW), compared with women who discontinued anti-TNF-α therapy before the third trimester.
METHODS: We identified a nationwide cohort of 219 women treated with anti-TNF-α during the pregnancy period and reviewed the medical records to extract clinical details. The exposed cohort (n = 113, 51.6\%) constituted pregnancies exposed to anti-TNF-α during the third trimester, and the unexposed cohort (n = 106, 48.4\%) constituted pregnancies with no anti-TNF-α during the third trimester. The association between anti-TNF-α therapy in the third trimester and adverse birth outcomes was studied (1) in those women who had clinical disease activity during pregnancy and (2) in women who had no clinical disease activity during pregnancy.
RESULTS: In women with disease activity, treated with anti-TNF-α during the third trimester, we found an adjusted odds ratio of 2.23 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-6.20) for preterm birth and 1.16 (95\% CI, 0.26-5.23) for LBW. Among women without disease activity, treated with anti-TNF-α therapy during the third trimester, we found an adjusted odds ratio of 3.36 (95\% CI, 0.31-36.46) for preterm birth and 0.86 (95\% CI, 0.05-14.95) for LBW.
CONCLUSIONS: For anti-TNF-α therapy in the third trimester, we found no statistically significant increased risk of either LBW or preterm birth.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of maternal exposure to asthma medications on the risk of congenital anomalies.
DESIGN: Meta-analysis of aggregated data from three cohort studies.
SETTING: Linkage between healthcare databases and EUROCAT congenital anomaly registries.
POPULATION: 519 242 pregnancies in Norway (2004-2010), Wales (2000-2010) and Funen, Denmark (2000-2010).
METHODS: Exposure defined as having at least one prescription for asthma medications issued (Wales) or dispensed (Norway, Denmark) from 91 days before to 91 days after the pregnancy start date. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated separately for each register and combined in meta-analyses.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ORs for all congenital anomalies and specific congenital anomalies.
RESULTS: Overall exposure prevalence was 3.76\%. For exposure to asthma medication in general, the adjusted OR (adjOR) for a major congenital anomaly was 1.21 (99\% CI 1.09-1.34) after adjustment for maternal age and socioeconomic position. The OR of anal atresia was significantly increased in pregnancies exposed to inhaled corticosteroids (3.40; 99\% CI 1.15-10.04). For severe congenital heart defects, an increased OR (1.97; 1.12-3.49) was associated with exposure to combination treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-2-agonists. Associations with renal dysplasia were driven by exposure to short-acting beta-2-agonists (2.37; 1.20-4.67).
CONCLUSION: The increased risk of congenital anomalies for women taking asthma medication is small with little confounding by maternal age or socioeconomic status. The study confirmed the association of inhaled corticosteroids with anal atresia found in earlier research and found potential new associations with combination treatment. The potential new associations should be interpreted with caution due to the large number of comparisons undertaken.
TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: This cohort study found a small increased risk of congenital anomalies for women taking asthma medication.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Childbirth is a potent trigger for the onset of psychiatric illness in women including postpartum depression (PPD) and postpartum psychosis (PP). Medical complications occurring during pregnancy and/or childbirth have been linked to postpartum psychiatric illness and sociodemographic factors. We evaluated if pregnancy and obstetrical predictors have similar effects on different types of postpartum psychiatric disorders.
METHOD: A population-based cohort study using Danish registers was conducted in 392 458 primiparous women with a singleton delivery between 1995 and 2012 and no previous psychiatric history. The main outcome was first-onset postpartum psychiatric episodes. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated for any psychiatric contact in four quarters for the first year postpartum.
RESULTS: PPD and postpartum acute stress reactions were associated with pregnancy and obstetrical complications. For PPD, hyperemesis gravidarum [IRR 2.69, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.93-3.73], gestational hypertension (IRR 1.84, 95\% CI 1.33-2.55), pre-eclampsia (IRR 1.45, 95\% CI 1.14-1.84) and Cesarean section (C-section) (IRR 1.32, 95\% CI 1.13-1.53) were associated with increased risk. For postpartum acute stress, hyperemesis gravidarum (IRR 1.93, 95\% CI 1.38-2.71), preterm birth (IRR 1.51, 95\% CI 1.30-1.75), gestational diabetes (IRR 1.42, 95\% CI 1.03-1.97) and C-section (IRR 1.36, 95\% CI 1.20-1.55) were associated with increased risk. In contrast, risk of PP was not associated with pregnancy or obstetrical complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy and obstetrical complications can increase the risk for PPD and acute stress reactions but not PP. Identification of postpartum women requiring secondary care is needed to develop targeted approaches for screening and treatment. Future work should focus on understanding the contributions of psychological stressors and underlying biology on the development of postpartum psychiatric illness.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We identified children born in 2000-2003, enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort, with data on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) reported by parents at age seven (n = 33 896) and age 11 (n = 27 561) and the children themselves around age 11 (n = 27 251). Information on oxytocin administration was provided in the Medical Birth Register. We estimated mean differences and odds ratios for childhood hyperactivity/inattention problems according to oxytocin exposure.
RESULTS: Synthetic oxytocin was administered in 26\% of the deliveries. We did not find the use of synthetic oxytocin during birth to be associated with childhood hyperactivity/inattention problems, whether analyzed in linear or logistic regression models.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support any effects of obstetric use of synthetic oxytocin on hyperactivity/inattention problems in children when measured with the SDQ subscale at 7 or 11 years of age.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12884-015-0757-z},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since 2007 the Danish Health and Medicines Authority has advised total alcohol abstinence from the time of trying to conceive and throughout pregnancy. The prevalence of binge drinking among pregnant Danish women has nevertheless been reported to be up to 48 \% during early pregnancy. Since the introduction of the recommendation of total abstinence, no studies have examined pre-pregnancy lifestyle and reproductive risk factors associated with this behaviour in a Danish context. The aims of this study were therefore to describe the prevalence of weekly alcohol consumption and binge drinking in early pregnancy among women living in the capital of Denmark. Secondly to identify pre-pregnancy lifestyle and reproductive risk factors associated with binge drinking during early pregnancy.
METHODS: Data were collected from September 2012 to August 2013 at the Department of Obstetrics, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. Self-reported information on each woman's socio-demographic characteristics, medical history, and lifestyle factors including alcohol habits was obtained from an electronic questionnaire filled out as part of the individual medical record. Descriptive analysis was conducted and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the potential associated risk factors (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)).
RESULTS: Questionnaires from 3,238 women were included. A majority of 70 \%, reported weekly alcohol consumption before pregnancy. The prevalence decreased to 3 \% during early pregnancy. The overall proportion of women reporting binge drinking during early pregnancy was 35 \% (n = 1,134). The following independent risk factors for binge drinking in early pregnancy were identified: lower degree of planned pregnancy, smoking and alcohol habits before pregnancy ((1 unit/weekly aOR 4.48, CI: 3.14 - 6.40), (2-7 units aOR 10.23, CI: 7.44-14.06), (≥8 units aOR 33.18, CI: 19.53-56.36)). Multiparity and the use of assisted reproductive technology were associated with lower odds of binge drinking in early pregnancy.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of weekly alcohol consumption decreased considerably during early pregnancy compared with pre-pregnancy levels. Nevertheless one third of the pregnant women engaged in binge drinking. Identification of risk factors for this behaviour renders it possible not only to design prevention strategies, but also to target those most at risk.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify modifiable risk factors for miscarriage and to estimate the preventable proportion of miscarriages that could be attributed to these.
DESIGN: Nationwide observational follow-up study.
SETTING: Denmark.
POPULATION: Ninety-one thousand four hundred and twenty seven pregnancies included in the Danish National Birth Cohort between 1996 and 2002.
METHODS: Information on potentially modifiable risk factors before and during pregnancy was collected by means of computer-assisted telephone interviews and linkage with Danish registers, ensuring almost complete follow-up of pregnancy outcome. Modifiable risk factors for miscarriage were identified by multiple Cox regression analysis, which provided the background for our estimations of population attributable fractions. In all, 88,373 pregnancies had full information on all covariates and were included in this analysis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Miscarriage before 22 completed weeks of gestation.
RESULTS: The potentially modifiable pre-pregnant risk factors associated with increased miscarriage risk were: age of 30 years or more at conception, underweight, and obesity. During pregnancy the modifiable risk factors were: alcohol consumption, lifting of {\textgreater}20 kg daily, and night work. We estimated that 25.2\% of the miscarriages might be prevented by reduction of all these risk factors to low risk levels. Modification of risk factors acting before and during pregnancy could lead to prevention of 14.7 and 12.5\%, respectively, of the miscarriages. Maternal age at conception and alcohol consumption were the most important risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Miscarriage risk is increased by multiple potentially modifiable risk factors and a considerable proportion of miscarriages may be preventable.},

DESIGN: Population based cohort study.
SETTING: Register based study in Denmark, 1997-2008.
PARTICIPANTS: 983,305 pregnancies identified in the Danish medical birth register and the Danish national hospital discharge register from 1 February 1997 to 31 December 2008 were linked to the Danish Register of Medicinal Product Statistics to obtain information on use of antiepileptic drugs.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk ratio of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth after use of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy, estimated by using binomial regression adjusting for potential confounders of maternal age, cohabitation, income, education, history of severe mental disorder, and history of drug misuse.
RESULTS: Antiepileptic drugs were used in a total of 4700 (0.5\%) pregnancies. 16 out of 100 pregnant women using antiepileptics and 13 out of 100 pregnant women not using antiepileptics experienced a spontaneous abortion. After adjusting for potential confounders pregnant women using antiepileptics had a 13\% higher risk of spontaneous abortions than pregnant women not using antiepileptics (adjusted risk ratio 1.13, 95\% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.24). However, the risk of spontaneous abortion was not increased in women with an epilepsy diagnosis (0.98, 0.87 to 1.09), only in women without a diagnosis of epilepsy (1.30, 1.14 to 1.49). In an analysis including women with at least two pregnancies with discordant antiepileptic drug use (for example, use in the first pregnancy but not in the second), the adjusted hazard ratio for spontaneous abortion was 0.83 (0.69 to 1.00) for exposed pregnancies compared with unexposed pregnancies. Stillbirth was identified in 18 women who used antiepileptic drugs (unadjusted risk ratio 1.29, 0.80 to 2.10).
CONCLUSION: Among women with epilepsy and when analysing the risk in antiepileptic drug discordant pregnancies in the same woman, we found no overall association between the use of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy and spontaneous abortions. Therefore unmeasured confounding may explain the slight increased risk for spontaneous abortion with any antiepileptic drug use (among women both with and without epilepsy). We found no association between antiepileptic drug use during pregnancy and stillbirth, but the statistical precision was low.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In Denmark, maternal mortality has been reported over the last century, both locally through hospital reports and in national registries. The purpose of this study was to analyze data from national medical registries of pregnancy-related deaths in Denmark 1985-1994 and to classify them according to the UK Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths (CEMD).
STUDY DESIGN: All deaths of women with a registered pregnancy within 12 months prior to the death were identified by comparing the Danish medical registries, death certificates, and relevant codes according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). All cases were classified using the UK CEMD classification. Cases of maternal death were further evaluated by an audit group.
RESULTS: 311 cases were classified. 92 deaths (29.6\%) occurred {\textless}or= 42 days after termination of pregnancy. Of these, 30 were classified as direct obstetric deaths, 30 as indirect obstetric deaths, and 32 as fortuitous deaths. Among the late pregnancy-related deaths ({\textgreater}42 days), 1 woman died from a direct obstetric cause, 46 from indirect causes, and 172 from fortuitous causes. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were the major cause of direct maternal deaths. The rate of maternal deaths constituted 9.8/100,000 maternities (i.e. the number of women delivering registrable live births at any gestation or stillbirths at 24 weeks of gestation or later).
CONCLUSION: This is the first systematic report on deaths in Denmark based on data from national registries. The maternal mortality rate in Denmark is comparable to the rates in other developed countries. Fortunately, statistics are low, but each case represents potential learning. Obstetric care has changed and classification methods differ between countries. Prospective registration and registry linkage seem to be a way to ensure completion. This retrospective study has provided the background for a prospective study on registration and evaluation of maternal mortality in Denmark.},

	shorttitle = {Does smoking during pregnancy mediate educational disparities in preterm delivery?},
	doi = {10.1111/ppe.12544},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Socio-economic disparities in preterm delivery have often been attributed to socially patterned smoking habits. However, most existing studies have used methods that potentially give biased estimates of the mediating effect of smoking. We used a contemporary mediation approach to study to which extent smoking during pregnancy mediates educational disparities in preterm delivery.
METHODS: We performed a comparative analysis of data from three large birth cohort studies: the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC), the Dutch Generation R Study, and the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Risk of preterm delivery by maternal education is reported as risk differences and decomposed into a part explained by smoking and a part explained by other pathways.
RESULTS: Proportions of preterm singleton deliveries were 4.8\%-4.9\% in all three cohorts. Total effects of maternal education were 2.0 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.4, 2.5), 3.2 (95\% CI 0.8, 5.2) and 2.0 (95\% CI 0.9, 3.0) excess preterm deliveries per 100 singleton deliveries in DNBC, Generation R and MoBa when comparing primary/lower secondary education to an academic degree or equivalent. Smoking mediated, respectively, 22\%, 10\% and 19\% of the excess risk in the DNBC, Generation R and MoBa cohorts. Adjustment for potential misclassification of smoking only increased mediated proportions slightly.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking during pregnancy explains part of educational disparities in preterm delivery, but the mediated proportion depends on the educational gradient in smoking, emphasising that educational disparities in preterm birth may be mediated by different risk factors in different countries.},

Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the risks and adjusted odds ratios for congenital malformations in four time periods: 1988-1992, 1993-1997, 1998-2002 and 2003-2007. Only major malformations were included.
RESULTS: The absolute risk for singletons of being born with a major malformation was 3.4\% among assisted reproductive technology children vs. 2.9\% among children spontaneously conceived during the study period. The relative risk of being born with a major congenital malformation between all assisted reproductive technology children and children spontaneously conceived remained similar through all four time periods (p = 0.39). However, we found that over time the number of children diagnosed with a major malformation increased in both groups across all four time periods.
CONCLUSION: When comparing children conceived after assisted reproductive technology and spontaneously conceived, the relative risk of being born with a major congenital malformation did not change during the study period.},

DESIGN: Cohort study.
SETTING: A university hospital.
SUBJECTS: Of 8,711 women with singleton pregnancies (1989-91), 5,875 returned questionnaires about risk factors and employment status at 16 and 30 weeks gestation. Of the respondents 5,552 were analysed in five groups: (1) women working throughout pregnancy, (2) women working in the first, but unemployed during the second trimester, (3) women on sick leave in the first and second trimester, (4) women unemployed throughout pregnancy, and (5) students. The association between employment status and having a small for gestational age infant and preterm delivery was evaluated, accounting for other risk factors.
RESULTS: Working women and students had the most and unemployed women the least favourable demographic risk factors. Women on sick leave had the least favourable obstetrical and medical history, followed by unemployed women. No clear pattern of the behavioural risk factors was found. Differences in risk of having a small for gestational age infant were a function of parity, smoking and maternal height. Adjustment for these factors plus education yielded a lower risk of preterm delivery in partially unemployed women and higher risk among women on sick leave compared to working women, accounted for by different risks of bleeding in the second and third trimester.
CONCLUSIONS: Comparison of pregnancy outcome among women with different work status should consider the differences in risk factor profile. Adjusting for such risk factors, we found no evidence that work per se had any detrimental or beneficial effects on the risk of having a small for gestational age infant or preterm delivery.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: This study aimed to estimate the association between prenatal exposure to antidepressants and risk of epilepsy in childhood, taking maternal depression into account.
METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study including all Danish singletons born alive between 1997 and 2008 (n = 734 237). Information on antidepressant medication and diagnosis of depression and epilepsy was obtained from Danish National Registers. The exposed group comprised children of mothers who used antidepressants from 30 days before pregnancy until the date of birth. The reference group comprised children of mothers who used no antidepressants from 6 months before pregnancy to birth. We estimated the hazard ratios (HR) of epilepsy and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) using Cox proportional hazard models.
RESULTS: We identified 12 438 (1.7\%) children exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy (including 30 days before pregnancy) and 5829 (0.8\%) children diagnosed with epilepsy in the follow-up time (mean: 6.7 years). Children exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy had a 27\% higher risk of epilepsy (aHR: 1.27; 95\%CI: 1.05-1.54) than children in the reference group. The estimate of this association was 1.71 (95\%CI: 1.10-2.66) if their mothers also had a registry-based hospital diagnosis of depression in the 6 months before pregnancy or during pregnancy and 1.14 (95\%CI: 0.91-1.43) if their mothers had no registry-based hospital diagnosis of depression. Children of mothers who used antidepressants from 2 to 6 months before pregnancy (but not during pregnancy) had an increased risk of epilepsy (aHR: 1.36; 95\%CI: 1.07-1.73).
CONCLUSIONS: Antidepressant use during pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of epilepsy among children whose mothers had also a registry-based hospital diagnosis of depression during pregnancy. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Up to one-third of women receive prescriptions for systemic antibacterial medications during pregnancy. This paper looks at the association between maternal use of systemic antibacterial medications during pregnancy and childhood cancer risk in the offspring using the prospective data on medication.
METHODS: A population-based follow-up study was carried out using Danish and Swedish register data. Exposure was maternal redemption of a prescription for a systemic antibacterial in the 3 months prior to pregnancy and during pregnancy (exposure window) documented in the national prescription registers, and offspring were followed up from birth to a cancer diagnosis, death, emigration, day before 15th birthday or end of follow-up, whichever came first. Timing, dosage, specific medication types and types of childhood cancer were also considered.
RESULTS: Mothers of 35.1\% (n = 506,194) of the children filled at least one prescription for systemic antibacterials during the exposure window. Exposed children had a hazard ratio of 1.08 (95\% confidence interval: 0.97, 1.20) compared with unexposed children. Statistically significant results were found for some specific medications (for example, 'other antibacterials'/Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code J01X) and combinations of cancer types and specific medications (leukaemia and other antibacterials, and hepatic cancers and tetracyclines).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that most antibacterial drugs used during pregnancy were not related to childhood cancer risk in the offspring. However, some may be associated with the development of some specific types of childhood cancers. Our findings need to be replicated in an independent data source.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Prescription drug use during pregnancy has increased during the past decades. However, little is known about prescription drug use for high-risk pregnancies. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of redeemed prescriptions in Danish pregnant women with and without previous psychiatric history.
METHODS: A Danish population-based descriptive study of 981 392 pregnancies ending in live-born singletons by 586 988 women aged 15 to 55 years between 1997 and 2012, of which 113 449 (11.6\%) pregnancies were by women with a psychiatric history prior to the index pregnancy. All prescription drugs redeemed during pregnancy were identified, and dispensing patterns among the women were reported by therapeutic classes of drugs, calendar year of childbirth, and trimester.
RESULTS: Overall, women with psychiatric history prior to pregnancy were more likely to fill a prescription (75.8\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 75.5-76.0\%), compared with women with no psychiatric history (64.5\%; 95\% CI, 64.4-64.6\%). The difference was observed even when psychotropic drug use was excluded and in all therapeutic classes except for antineoplastic and immunomodulating drugs. The most commonly prescribed drugs were anti-infectives. Approximately 44.7\% (95\% CI, 44.5-45.0\%) of women with psychiatric history and 31.3\% (95\% CI, 31.2-31.4\%) of women with no psychiatric history redeemed more than one therapeutic class of drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: Women with a psychiatric history were more likely to redeem prescriptions during pregnancy across almost all drug classes, especially anti-infectives. Two thirds of all women redeemed at least one prescription drug during pregnancy and one third more than one drug class. KEY POINTS We mapped prescription drug use of almost 600 000 women during almost one million pregnancies with focus on women with a history of psychiatric disorder before conception compared with women with no such history. Pregnant women with a previous psychiatric disorder were more likely to redeem prescription drugs compared with pregnant women without a previous psychiatric disorder. The observed overall difference was not due to obvious differences in psychotropic drug use. The difference was evident across calendar years, all trimesters, and almost all drug classes, but to a large extent in anti-infectives, among those mainly antibiotics. Two thirds of pregnant women redeemed prescription drugs during pregnancy, and one third redeemed more than one drug class. Health professionals should be aware of comorbid conditions requiring multiple drug use during pregnancy with the risk of unknown fetal effects.},

METHOD: A linkage between various Danish national health registries was performed to identify all recorded pregnancies from 1999 to 2010. Use of ADHD medication was defined as a redeemed prescription on methylphenidate, modafinil, or atomoxetine from 28 days prior to the first day of the last menstrual period until the end of pregnancy.
RESULTS: Of the 1 054 494 registered pregnancies, 480 were exposed to ADHD medication. From 2003 to the first quarter of 2010, use of ADHD medication during pregnancy increased from 5 to 533 per 100 000 person-years. A similar increase was observed among Danish women of childbearing age. Compared with unexposed, women who used ADHD medication during pregnancy were more often younger, single, lower educated, received social security benefits, and used other psychopharmaca. Exposed pregnancies were more likely to result in induced abortions on maternal request (odds ratio = 4.70, 95\%CI = 3.77-5.85), induced abortions on special indication (odds ratio = 2.99, 95\%CI = 1.34-6.67), and miscarriage (odds ratio = 2.07, 95\%CI = 1.51-2.84) compared with unexposed pregnancies.
CONCLUSIONS: The number of pregnancies exposed to ADHD medication has increased similarly to the increase in use of ADHD medication among women of childbearing age. Use of ADHD medication in pregnancy was associated with different indicators of maternal disadvantage and with increased risk of induced abortion and miscarriage.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may activate the immune system and cause asthma.
AIM: To investigate the association of prenatal exposure to PPIs and histamine 2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) with risk of asthma.
METHODS: In this cohort study, 197,060 singletons born between 1996 and 2008 in northern Denmark were followed until the end of 2009. Data were obtained through Danish medical registries. Asthma in offspring was defined as at least two prescriptions of both a β-agonist and an inhaled glucocorticoid and/or a hospital diagnosis of asthma during the follow-up. Cox proportional-hazard regression was used to compute incidence rate ratios, adjusting for covariates.
RESULTS: A total of 2238 (1.1\%) children were prenatally exposed to PPIs and 24,506 (12.4\%) children developed asthma during follow-up (median follow-up = 6.8 years). The adjusted IRR (aIRR) of asthma associated with prenatal exposure to PPIs was 1.41 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.27-1.56), compared with those unexposed. The association did not vary by trimester of exposure, and prenatal exposure to H2RAs was associated with similar increase in risk. The aIRR for maternal PPI and H2RA use in the year after, but not during pregnancy was 1.32 (95\% CI: 1.20-1.46) and 1.13 (0.93-1.36), respectively, compared with non-use during and in the year after pregnancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to both PPIs and H2RAs was associated with an increased risk of asthma in our study. Because the observed association is not drug specific and also observed for maternal postnatal use it may be explained by a 'class effect' or maternal underlying condition.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux are common in pregnancy, but there are limited data on the risk of birth defects associated with exposure to proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) in early pregnancy.
METHODS: We conducted a cohort study to assess the association between exposure to PPIs during pregnancy and the risk of major birth defects among all infants born alive in Denmark between January 1996 and September 2008. We linked data from nationwide registries, including individual-level information on exposure to PPIs (prescriptions), birth defects, and potential confounders. Major birth defects, diagnosed within the first year of life, were categorized according to the standardized classification scheme of the European surveillance of congenital anomalies (EUROCAT). Our primary analyses assessed the use of PPIs from 4 weeks before conception through 12 weeks of gestation and from 0 through 12 weeks of gestation (first trimester).
RESULTS: Among 840,968 live births, 5082 involved exposure to PPIs between 4 weeks before conception and the end of the first trimester of pregnancy. There were 174 major birth defects in infants whose mothers had been exposed to PPIs during this period (3.4\%), as compared with 21,811 in the group whose mothers had not been exposed (2.6\%) (adjusted prevalence odds ratio, 1.23; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 1.44). In analyses limited to exposure during the first trimester, there were 118 major birth defects among 3651 infants exposed to PPIs (3.2\%), and the adjusted prevalence odds ratio was 1.10 (95\% CI, 0.91 to 1.34). The risk of birth defects was not significantly increased in secondary analyses of exposure to individual PPIs during the first trimester or in analyses limited to the offspring of women who had filled PPI prescriptions and received enough doses to have a theoretical chance of first-trimester exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort, exposure to PPIs during the first trimester of pregnancy was not associated with a significantly increased risk of major birth defects. (Funded by the Danish Medical Research Council and the Lundbeck Foundation.).},

	abstract = {Opioid use during pregnancy has serious consequences for mother and baby. The true extent of the problem is unknown and there is a need for better screening. Existing guidelines with respect to the management of pregnant women with opioid use are based on limited evidence. To improve recommendations for optimal identification, management, and treatment, publications on opioids in pregnancy were reviewed. Published literature from 2007 to 2017 was searched in PubMed, Cochrane and Embase databases. The review employed 60 publications from 210 studies identified, that were of varying quality and included randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and Cochrane reviews. The prevalence of opioid use in pregnancy is underestimated. Screening by urine testing and self-reporting is acceptable to identify fetal exposure. To minimize risk, opioid agonist pharmacotherapy should replace the continued use of opioids or detoxification. Current guidelines recommend methadone and buprenorphine equally. However, recent studies indicate that buprenorphine has advantages over methadone. Accordingly, we suggest buprenorphine as first-line therapy.

In a large, prospectively ascertained cohort of pregnant mothers and their offspring, we examined infants born ⩾32 weeks for associations between fever exposure in each trimester and ASD risk using logistic regression. Maternal exposure to second-trimester fever was associated with increased ASD risk, adjusting for presence of fever in other trimesters and confounders (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.40; 95\% confidence interval, 1.09-1.79), with a similar, but nonsignificant, point estimate in the first trimester. Risk increased markedly with exposure to three or more fever episodes after 12 weeks' gestation (aOR, 3.12; 1.28-7.63). ASD risk appears to increase with maternal fever, particularly in the second trimester. Risk magnified dose dependently with exposure to multiple fevers after 12 weeks' gestation.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fever and infections are common events during pregnancy, and have been shown to be associated with neurodevelopmental impairment in the offspring. The evidence in relation to attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is, however, nonexistent for fever and limited for infections. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the impact of these exposures on the occurrence of ADHD in the offspring, considering gestational timing as well as intensity of exposure.
METHODS: The study was conducted within the Danish National Birth Cohort, using data on 89,146 pregnancies enrolled during 1996-2002. Exposure to fever and infections were assessed prospectively in two computer-assisted telephone interviews during pregnancy and ADHD status in the child was determined using registry information from three nation-wide patient and prescription registers. Stratified Cox regressions were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios of ADHD occurrence.
RESULTS: The analyses revealed no overall association between maternal exposure to fever or infections and ADHD in the offspring [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 1.03, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-1.13 and aHR: 1.01, 95\% CI: 0.92-1.11]. When the exposures were considered during specific gestational periods, increased rates of ADHD were observed following fever in gestational weeks 9-12 (aHR: 1.33, 95\% CI: 1.12-1.58), and genitourinary infections in weeks 33-36 (aHR: 1.60, 95\% CI: 1.13-2.26).
CONCLUSIONS: Although no overall adverse association between fever and infections in pregnancy and ADHD in the offspring was found, the analyses indicated that exposures during specific time windows of the pregnancy could be associated with increased ADHD occurrence.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is the most commonly used medication for pain and fever during pregnancy in many countries. Research data suggest that acetaminophen is a hormone disruptor, and abnormal hormonal exposures in pregnancy may influence fetal brain development.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether prenatal exposure to acetaminophen increases the risk for developing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behavioral problems or hyperkinetic disorders (HKDs) in children.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We studied 64,322 live-born children and mothers enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort during 1996-2002.
EXPOSURES: Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was assessed prospectively via 3 computer-assisted telephone interviews during pregnancy and 6 months after child birth.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: To ascertain outcome information we used (1) parental reports of behavioral problems in children 7 years of age using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; (2) retrieved HKD diagnoses from the Danish National Hospital Registry or the Danish Psychiatric Central Registry prior to 2011; and (3) identified ADHD prescriptions (mainly Ritalin) for children from the Danish Prescription Registry. We estimated hazard ratios for receiving an HKD diagnosis or using ADHD medications and risk ratios for behavioral problems in children after prenatal exposure to acetaminophen.
RESULTS: More than half of all mothers reported acetaminophen use while pregnant. Children whose mothers used acetaminophen during pregnancy were at higher risk for receiving a hospital diagnosis of HKD (hazard ratio = 1.37; 95\% CI, 1.19-1.59), use of ADHD medications (hazard ratio = 1.29; 95\% CI, 1.15-1.44), or having ADHD-like behaviors at age 7 years (risk ratio = 1.13; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.27). Stronger associations were observed with use in more than 1 trimester during pregnancy, and exposure response trends were found with increasing frequency of acetaminophen use during gestation for all outcomes (ie, HKD diagnosis, ADHD medication use, and ADHD-like behaviors; P trend {\textless} .001). Results did not appear to be confounded by maternal inflammation, infection during pregnancy, the mother's mental health problems, or other potential confounders we evaluated.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy is associated with a higher risk for HKDs and ADHD-like behaviors in children. Because the exposure and outcome are frequent, these results are of public health relevance but further investigations are needed.},

In this article, we illustrate use of the negative control exposure (NCE) approach to evaluate uncontrolled confounding bias in observational studies on pregnancy drug safety and explain the causal assumptions behind the method. We conducted an NCE analysis and evaluated the associations between maternal acetaminophen use during different exposure periods and ADHD among 8,856 children born in 1993-2005 to women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study II cohort. Information on regular maternal acetaminophen use was collected prospectively in biennial questionnaires. A total of 721 children (8.1\%) in the cohort had been diagnosed with ADHD as reported by the mothers. Our NCE analysis suggested that only acetaminophen use at the time of pregnancy was associated with childhood ADHD (odds ratio = 1.34, 95\% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.72), and the effect estimates for the 2 NCE periods (about 4 years before and 4 years after the pregnancy) were null. Our findings corroborate those of prior reports suggesting that prenatal acetaminophen exposure may influence neurodevelopment. The lack of an association between acetaminophen use in the pre- and postpregnancy exposure periods and ADHD provides assurance that uncontrolled time-invariant factors do not explain this association.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To estimate the association between maternal use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and of paternal use before pregnancy with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in offspring while adjusting for familial risk for ADHD and indications of acetaminophen use.
METHODS: Diagnoses were obtained from the Norwegian Patient Registry for 112 973 offspring from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, including 2246 with ADHD. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for an ADHD diagnosis by using Cox proportional hazard models.
RESULTS: After adjusting for maternal use of acetaminophen before pregnancy, familial risk for ADHD, and indications of acetaminophen use, we observed a modest association between any prenatal maternal use of acetaminophen in 1 (HR = 1.07; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.96-1.19), 2 (HR = 1.22; 95\% CI 1.07-1.38), and 3 trimesters (HR = 1.27; 95\% CI 0.99-1.63). The HR for more than 29 days of maternal acetaminophen use was 2.20 (95\% CI 1.50-3.24). Use for {\textless}8 days was negatively associated with ADHD (HR = 0.90; 95\% CI 0.81-1.00). Acetaminophen use for fever and infections for 22 to 28 days was associated with ADHD (HR = 6.15; 95\% CI 1.71-22.05). Paternal and maternal use of acetaminophen were similarly associated with ADHD.
CONCLUSIONS: Short-term maternal use of acetaminophen during pregnancy was negatively associated with ADHD in offspring. Long-term maternal use of acetaminophen during pregnancy was substantially associated with ADHD even after adjusting for indications of use, familial risk of ADHD, and other potential confounders.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen is a widely used medication for fever and pain management during pregnancy. However, recent studies have found a possible connection between maternal prenatal acetaminophen use and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore the association between maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in offspring.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were searched from their initial publications through November 2018 for studies.
STUDY SELECTION: We included all studies that examined the association between maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in offspring if the authors reported odds ratios, risk ratios, hazard ratios, regression coefficient, standard error and 95\% confidence intervals.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data on the definition of exposure and outcome, exposed, non-exposed and total number of participants in the sample population, adjusted potential confounders and outcome parameters. Study quality was also assessed.
RESULTS: Eight cohort studies with a total of 244,940 participants were included. Maternal exposure to acetaminophen during pregnancy increased the risk of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in offspring with a pooled adjusted risk ratio of 1.25 (95\% confidence interval = [1.17, 1.34]). Children exposed prenatally to acetaminophen in the third trimester seemed to have the greatest risk of developing attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (risk ratio: 1.26; 95\% confidence interval = [1.08, 1.47]). In addition, a longer duration of maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy was correlated with a higher risk ratio. Children whose mothers used acetaminophen for 28 or more days during gestation had a higher risk of developing attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (risk ratio: 1.63; 95\% confidence interval = [1.23, 2.16]).
CONCLUSION: There is an association between maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in offspring. The timing and duration of acetaminophen use during pregnancy may have a major effect on the risk of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.},

We reviewed available data on the prevalence of alcohol intake during lactation, the influence of alcohol on breastfeeding, the pharmacokinetics of alcohol in lactating women and nursing infants and the effects of alcohol intake on nursing infants. A systematic search was performed in PubMed from origin to May 2013, and 41 publications were included in the review. Approximately half of all lactating women in Western countries consume alcohol while breastfeeding. Alcohol intake inhibits the milk ejection reflex, causing a temporary decrease in milk yield. The alcohol concentrations in breast milk closely resemble those in maternal blood. The amount of alcohol presented to nursing infants through breast milk is approximately 5-6\% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose, and even in a theoretical case of binge drinking, the children would not be subjected to clinically relevant amounts of alcohol. Newborns metabolize alcohol at approximately half the rate of adults. Minute behavioural changes in infants exposed to alcohol-containing milk have been reported, but the literature is contradictory. Any long-term consequences for the children of alcohol-abusing mothers are yet unknown, but occasional drinking while breastfeeding has not been convincingly shown to adversely affect nursing infants. In conclusion, special recommendations aimed at lactating women are not warranted. Instead, lactating women should simply follow standard recommendations on alcohol consumption.},

Very little is known about potential hazards of in utero exposure to methylphenidate. We conducted this study to estimate the risk of major congenital malformations following first-trimester in utero exposure to methylphenidate.
METHOD: Data from 2005 to 2012 were extracted from the Danish National Patient Register, the Danish National Prescription Registry, the Medical Birth Registry, and the Danish Civil Registration System. Exposure was defined as having redeemed 1 or more prescriptions for methylphenidate within a time window defined as 14 days before the beginning of the first trimester up to the end of the first trimester. Each exposed subject was propensity score-matched to 10 unexposed subjects with respect to maternal age, smoking status, body mass index, length of education, calendar year of completion of pregnancy, and concomitant use of antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
RESULTS: We included 222 exposed and 2,220 unexposed pregnancies in the analysis. There was no statistically significant increase in major malformations (point prevalence ratio = 0.8; 95\% CI, 0.3-1.8) or cardiac malformations (point prevalence ratio = 0.9; 95\% CI, 0.2-3.0). Sensitivity analyses using different definitions of exposure or previous users of methylphenidate as the unexposed comparison cohort yielded comparable results.
CONCLUSIONS: First-trimester in utero exposure to methylphenidate does not appear to be associated with a substantially (ie, more than 2-fold) increased overall risk of major congenital malformations.},

DESIGN: Register-based, population-wide, cohort study.
SETTING: Denmark, from 2000 to 2010.
POPULATION: All pregnancies among Danish residents during the period 2000-2010 were included for analysis.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Danish Medical Birth Registry, the Danish National Patient Registry, and the Registry of Medicinal Product Statistics. The filled prescriptions for systemic antibacterial, antimycotic, and antiviral drugs, as well as intravaginally applied antibiotics, were analysed. Associations with demographic variables were assessed using multivariate analysis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Filled prescriptions for antibiotic drugs during pregnancy.
RESULTS: We included 987 973 pregnancies in Denmark from 2000 to 2010; 38.9\% of women with a delivery and 14.8\% of women with a miscarriage or termination of pregnancy had one or more antibiotic treatments during pregnancy. Systemic antibacterial drugs were the most frequently used drug group, with filled prescriptions for 33.4\% of all deliveries and 12.6\% of all abortions. This proportion increased from 28.4\% in 2000 to 37.0\% in 2010 among deliveries. The biggest change was seen for pivmecillinam, which increased among deliveries from 6.3\% in 2000 to 19.5\% in 2010. Obese (odds ratio 1.51; 95\% CI 1.47-1.56), young (odds ratio 1.35; 95\% CI 1.30-1.39), and low-educated women (odds ratio 1.37; 95\% CI 1.35-1.1.39) tended to fill more prescriptions of antibiotics during pregnancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the number of women who filled prescriptions of antibiotics increased during the 11-year study period. In 2010, at least 41.5\% of all deliveries were exposed to antibiotic therapy during pregnancy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several case reports and epidemiological studies have raised concern about the abuse potential of pregabalin, the use of which has increased substantially over the last decade. Pregabalin is, in some cases, used for recreational purposes and it has incurred attention among drug abusers for causing euphoric and dissociative effects when taken in doses exceeding normal therapeutic dosages or used by alternative routes of administration, such as nasal insufflation or venous injection. The magnitude of the abuse potential and the mechanism behind it are not fully known.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to present a systematic review of the data concerning the abuse potential of pregabalin.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search and reviewed the preclinical, clinical and epidemiological data on the abuse potential of pregabalin.
RESULTS: We included preclinical (n = 17), clinical (n = 19) and epidemiological (n = 13) studies addressing the abuse potential of pregabalin. We also reviewed case reports (n = 9) concerning abuse of pregabalin. The preclinical studies indicated that pregabalin possesses modulatory effects on the GABA and glutamate systems, leaving room for an abuse potential. Further, clinical studies reported euphoria as a frequent side effect in patients treated with pregabalin. The majority of case reports concerning abuse of pregabalin involved patients with a history of substance abuse and, similarly, epidemiological studies found evidence of abuse, especially among opiate abusers.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the available literature suggests an important clinical abuse potential of pregabalin and prescribers should pay attention to signs of abuse, especially in patients with a history of substance abuse.},

METHODS: Data were obtained from the Danish Medical Birth Register, the Register for Legally Induced Abortions, the Danish National Patient Register and the Register of Medicinal Product Statistics. Data were linked through a unique personal identifier by Statistics Denmark.
RESULTS: The use of APs increased 2.5-fold from a prevalence of 1.5 per 1000 pregnancies to 3.8 for pregnancies ending in a delivery. Use of mood-stabilizing AEDs increased from a prevalence of 0.1 to 2.1 during the study period. The prevalence for APs and mood-stabilizing AEDs was nearly twice as high for pregnancies ending in miscarriage or termination compared to pregnancies ending in delivery. A marked increase in the prevalence of ADs use during pregnancy was seen from 2000-2011 (from 6 to 41 per 1000 pregnancies ending in a delivery) but appears slightly in decline. Age, smoking, obesity and social status were generally associated with increased use of psychotropic drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of APs, ADs and mood-stabilizing AEDs during pregnancy has increased substantially in Denmark from 2000-2016. The use of ADs appears to be slightly in decline since 2011.},

	abstract = {The issue of antipsychotic treatment during pregnancy is subject to substantial uncertainty and some controversy among healthcare providers, specifically pertaining to second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) that are subject to a large gap in safety data during pregnancy compared with antidepressants. The amount of safety data for the use of SGAs during pregnancy is rapidly increasing, thus constantly changing the level of evidence. We performed a clinically focused review on the safety of SGA during pregnancy. Twenty-three studies provided various pregnancy outcomes for 14,382 pregnant women exposed to an SGA during pregnancy. In utero exposure to aripiprazole, olanzapine, and quetiapine is not associated with increased risks of major congenital malformations, whereas risperidone and paliperidone may be associated with a very minor increased risk of congenital malformations. Safety data on ziprasidone and clozapine remain scarce and insufficient for a quantitative safety evaluation. No or minimal safety data are available for amisulpride, asenapine, lurasidone, and sertindole. For other pregnancy outcomes of interest, e.g. miscarriage, stillbirth, and small for gestational age, the available data overall do not suggest a clinically important increased risk, and do not allow for a meaningful stratification on individual drug level. Furthermore, for neonatal adaption and childhood neurodevelopment, the data do not allow for a meaningful risk assessment. It is imperative that factors in addition to safety data, e.g. individual disease history, characteristics and treatment response, adverse reaction profile, and patient preferences, be considered for the individual patient when choosing specific SGA treatment during pregnancy.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Antithyroid drugs (ATDs) may have teratogenic effects, but more evidence is needed on the risk and types of birth defects after the use of methimazole (MMI) and propylthiouracil (PTU). This study aimed to evaluate the association between the use of ATDs in early pregnancy and birth defects.
DESIGN: Swedish nationwide register-based cohort study.
METHODS: The study included 684 340 children live-born in Sweden from 2006 to 2012. Exposure groups defined by maternal ATD use in early pregnancy were MMI (n = 162); PTU (n = 218); MMI and PTU (n = 66); ATD before or after, but not in pregnancy (n = 1551) and non-exposed (never ATD (n = 682 343)). Outcome was cumulative incidence of birth defects diagnosed before two years of age.
RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of birth defects was not significantly different in children exposed to MMI (6.8\%, P = 0.6) or PTU (6.4\%, P = 0.4) vs non-exposed (8.0\%). For subtypes of birth defects, MMI was associated with an increased incidence of septal heart defects (P = 0.02). PTU was associated with ear (P = 0.005) and obstructive urinary system malformations (P = 0.006). A case of choanal atresia was observed after exposure to both MMI and PTU. The incidence of birth defects in children born to mothers who received ATD before or after, but not in pregnancy, was 8.8\% and not significantly different from non-exposed (P = 0.3), MMI exposed (P = 0.4) or PTU exposed (P = 0.2).
CONCLUSIONS: MMI and PTU were associated with subtypes of birth defects previously reported, but the frequency of ATD exposure in early pregnancy was low and severe malformations described in the MMI embryopathy were rarely observed.},

Biologic agents, notably Tumor Necrosis Factor inhibitors (TNFi), are the only current non-contraindicated systemic treatment option during pregnancy. TNFi comprised of complete immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies antibodies (adalimumab, golimumab, and infliximab) actively cross the placenta from the second trimester and are detectable in the child up to one year postpartum. Data on safety of TNFi are conflicting; however a trend towards drug-specific harm has been reported, with increased risk of congenital malformations and preterm birth. TNFi exposure may alter the immune system of the infant towards hypersensitivity and reduced response to intracellular infections. Confounding by indication should be considered, as chronic inflammatory disease itself may pose a risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The quality of the current evidence is very low and no studies specifically address TNFi safety in women with psoriasis. Nonetheless, risks associated with TNFi treatment must be balanced against the as-yet uncertain risk of adverse outcomes in infants born to women with severe psoriasis. We searched PubMed using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and identified relevant studies and guidelines. Herein, we present the current knowledge of the use and safety of TNFi during pregnancy in women with psoriasis.},

Methods This population-based cohort study using national registers in Denmark comprised 915 128 liveborn singletons during 1998-2012. We categorised children into three mutually exclusive exposure groups according to maternal redemption of an antidepressant prescription from 2 years before pregnancy until delivery of the index child: Unexposed (N = 863 033), prior user (use before but not during pregnancy) (N = 30 607), and use during pregnancy (N = 21 488). The children were followed from birth until first diagnosis of cancer, death, emigration, or December 31, 2012, whichever came first. The children were followed maximum 14.9 years and contributed to 6.9 × 106 person-years at risk. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of cancer using Cox regression with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Results In total, 1298 (0.1\%) children were diagnosed with cancer. Antidepressant use during pregnancy was not associated with a significantly increased risk of childhood cancer in general; the HR was 1.03 (95\% CI, 0.63-1.68), compared to children born by mothers who discontinued antidepressant use prior to pregnancy. The association between in utero exposure to antidepressants and childhood cancer did not depend on type or duration of antidepressant use. There was no strong evidence indicating a higher risk of leukaemia or nervous system tumours among children exposed to antidepressants in utero. Conclusion Antidepressant use during pregnancy was not significantly associated with childhood cancer in general nor with leukaemia or nervous system tumours in specific.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: It has been suggested that maternal depression during pregnancy is associated with asthma in the offspring, but the role of medical treatment of depression is not known. Our goal was to examine whether prenatal antidepressant use increases the risk of asthma in the offspring.
METHODS: A cohort study was performed among all live singletons born in Denmark between 1996 and 2007. Mothers who had a diagnosis of depressive disorder and/or who used antidepressants 1 year before or during the index pregnancy were identified. Using a Cox proportional hazards regression model, we estimated the hazard ratio (HR) for asthma in the offspring after antidepressant use during pregnancy.
RESULTS: Of the 733,685 children identified, 84,683 had a diagnosis of asthma. A total of 21,371 children were exposed to prenatal maternal depression (ie, a diagnosis of depressive disorder or use of antidepressants 1 year before or during pregnancy). Prenatal maternal depression was associated with childhood asthma (HR: 1.25 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.20-1.30]). Overall, 8895 children were exposed to antidepressants in utero. Compared with children born to mothers with prenatal depression and no antidepressant use during pregnancy, the HR for asthma after any antidepressant use during pregnancy was 1.00 (95\% CI: 0.93-1.08). HRs after use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors only, newer antidepressants only, and older antidepressants only were 0.95 (95\% CI: 0.88-1.03), 1.11 (95\% CI: 0.89-1.39), and 1.26 (95\% CI: 1.02-1.55), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Antidepressant use during pregnancy generally did not increase the risk of asthma. Only use of older antidepressants was associated with an increased risk of asthma.},

	abstract = {Background: Rare cases of birth defects after the use of methimazole (MMI) or carbimazole to treat hyperthyroidism in early pregnancy have been reported since 1972, whereas propylthiouracil (PTU) has not been considered teratogenic. Recently, two studies reported birth defects after the use of MMI in early pregnancy to affect 2–4\% of exposed children, and one study also found birth defects after the use of PTU. On the other hand, some published studies did not find associations between the use of thionamides and birth defects.Summary: The methods used in the two positive and the four negative reports are reviewed. The two positive studies included a sufficient number of children exposed to MMI (n = 1231 and 1097) to evaluate the studied outcomes, whereas the four negative studies included a much lower number of exposed children (n = 73, 108, 30, and 124). Considering PTU, the birth defects observed in one study were in general milder and tended to be diagnosed and registered only when they resulted in complications and led to surgery after one year of age. None of the negative studies has investigated outcomes after one year of age.Conclusion: Studies finding no associations between early pregnancy exposure to antithyroid drugs and birth defects were either not sufficiently powered or did not study outcomes at optimal ages.},

PARTICIPANTS: Danish pregnant women and their live-born children, including 1,243,353 children from a Nationwide Register-Based Cohort (NRBC), 1997 to 2016; 8830 children from the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC), 1997 to 2003; and 14,483 children from the North Denmark Region Pregnancy Cohort (NDRPC), 2011 to 2015.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Birth defects diagnosed before 2 years of age.
RESULTS: In the NRBC, altogether 2718 (0.2\%) children had been exposed to ATD in early pregnancy. The overall frequency of birth defects was 6.7\% (95\% CI, 6.7\% to 6.8\%) in nonexposed children and higher after exposure to methimazole/carbimazole (9.6\%; 95\% CI, 8.2\% to 11.2\%) and propylthiouracil (8.3\%; 95\% CI, 6.7\% to 10.3\%). On the other hand, the frequency of maternal thyroid dysfunction in early pregnancy was similar in the random cohort and in cases of birth defect in the DNBC (12.4 vs 12.6\%, P = 0.8) and the NDRPC (15.1 vs 15.4\%, P = 0.8).
CONCLUSIONS: Results corroborate an increased risk of birth defects associated with the use of ATD in early pregnancy and suggest that abnormal maternal thyroid function is not a major risk factor for birth defects.},

Evidence is still lacking in regard to the safety and choice of ATD in early pregnancy.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine to which degree the use of methimazole (MMI)/carbimazole (CMZ) and propylthiouracil (PTU) in early pregnancy is associated with an increased prevalence of birth defects.
METHODS: This Danish nationwide register-based cohort study included 817 093 children live-born from 1996 to 2008. Exposure groups were assigned according to maternal ATD use in early pregnancy: PTU (n = 564); MMI/CMZ (n = 1097); MMI/CMZ and PTU (shifted in early pregnancy [n = 159]); no ATD (ATD use, but not in pregnancy [n = 3543]); and nonexposed (never ATD use [n = 811 730]). Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) for diagnosis of a birth defect before 2 years of age in exposed versus nonexposed children.
RESULTS: The prevalence of birth defects was high in children exposed to ATD in early pregnancy (PTU, 8.0\%; MMI/CMZ, 9.1\%; MMI/CMZ and PTU, 10.1\%; no ATD, 5.4\%; nonexposed, 5.7\%; P {\textless} .001). Both maternal use of MMI/CMZ (adjusted OR = 1.66 [95\% CI 1.35-2.04]) and PTU (1.41 [1.03-1.92]) and maternal shift between MMI/CMZ and PTU in early pregnancy (1.82 [1.08-3.07]) were associated with an increased OR of birth defects. MMI/CMZ and PTU were associated with urinary system malformation, and PTU with malformations in the face and neck region. Choanal atresia, esophageal atresia, omphalocele, omphalomesenteric duct anomalies, and aplasia cutis were common in MMI/CMZ-exposed children (combined, adjusted OR = 21.8 [13.4-35.4]).
CONCLUSIONS: Both MMI/CMZ and PTU were associated with birth defects, but the spectrum of malformations differed. More studies are needed to corroborate results in regard to early pregnancy shift from MMI/CMZ to PTU. New ATD with fewer side effects should be developed.},

From Danish nationwide prescription data, we obtained information on primary care use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta blockers, diuretics, aldosterone receptor antagonists, and calcium channel blockers. During 1999 to 2015, the use of antihypertensive drugs per 1,000 inhabitants/day increased from 184 to 379 defined daily doses (DDD), corresponding to a rise in the prevalence proportion of users from ≈20\% to ≈35\%. From 1999 to 2015, a notable increase was observed for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (from 29 to 105 DDD per 1,000 inhabitants/day ≈260\%) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (from 13 to 73 DDD per 1,000 inhabitants/day ≈520\%). For diuretics the use remained stable, with a slight decrease (from 89 to 81 DDD per 1,000 inhabitants/day ≈-10\%). The use of aldosterone receptor antagonists increased until 2007 and remained unchanged at around 3.5 DDD per 1,000 inhabitants/day thereafter (average change ≈65\%). The use of beta blockers doubled during the study period (from 17 to 34 DDD per 1,000 inhabitants/day ≈100\%), entirely driven by increasing use of metoprolol. Similar trends were observed for calcium channel blockers (from 34 to 82 DDD per 1,000 inhabitants/day ≈140\%), where amlodipine drove the overall increase. In conclusion, antihypertensive drug use has increased remarkably during the past 2 decades.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the widespread use, only sparse information is available on the safety of gabapentin during pregnancy. We sought to evaluate the association between gabapentin exposure during pregnancy and risk of adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using the United States Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) dataset, we conducted a population-based study of 1,753,865 Medicaid-eligible pregnancies between January 2000 and December 2013. We examined the risk of major congenital malformations and cardiac defects associated with gabapentin exposure during the first trimester (T1), and the risk of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB), small for gestational age (SGA), and neonatal intensive care unit admission (NICUa) associated with gabapentin exposure early, late, or both early and late in pregnancy. Gabapentin-unexposed pregnancies served as the reference. We estimated relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) using fine stratification on the propensity score (PS) to control for over 70 confounders (e.g., maternal age, race/ethnicity, indications for gabapentin, other pain conditions, hypertension, diabetes, use of opioids, and specific morphine equivalents). We identified 4,642 pregnancies exposed in T1 (mean age = 28 years; 69\% white), 3,745 exposed in early pregnancy only (28 years; 67\% white), 556 exposed in late pregnancy only (27 years; 60\% white), and 1,275 exposed in both early and late pregnancy (29 years; 75\% white). The reference group consisted of 1,744,447 unexposed pregnancies (24 years; 40\% white). The adjusted RR for major malformations was 1.07 (95\% CI 0.94-1.21, p = 0.33) and for cardiac defects 1.12 (0.89-1.40, p = 0.35). Requiring ≥2 gabapentin dispensings moved the RR to 1.40 (1.03-1.90, p = 0.03) for cardiac defects. There was a higher risk of preterm birth among women exposed to gabapentin either late (RR, 1.28 [1.08-1.52], p {\textless} 0.01) or both early and late in pregnancy (RR, 1.22 [1.09-1.36], p {\textless} 0.001), SGA among women exposed to gabapentin early (1.17 [1.02-1.33], p = 0.02), late (1.39 [1.01-1.91], p = 0.05), or both early and late in pregnancy (RR, 1.32 [1.08-1.60], p {\textless} 0.01), and NICU admission among women exposed to gabapentin both early and late in pregnancy (RR, 1.35 [1.20-1.52], p {\textless} 0.001). There was no higher risk of preeclampsia among women exposed to gabapentin after adjustment. Study limitations include the potential for residual confounding and exposure misclassification.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large population-based study, we did not find evidence for an association between gabapentin exposure during early pregnancy and major malformations overall, although there was some evidence of a higher risk of cardiac malformations. Maternal use of gabapentin, particularly late in pregnancy, was associated with a higher risk of PTB, SGA, and NICUa.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Methimazole (MMI) and propylthiouracil (PTU) are both associated with birth defects and may also rarely be associated with agranulocytosis and liver failure. The frequency of these side effects when antithyroid drugs (ATDs) are used in the population in general or in pregnancy remains to be elucidated.
DESIGN: All individuals registered as the parent of a live-born child in Denmark, 1973–2008, were identified (n = 2 299 952) and studied from 1995 through 2010 for the use of ATDs. Outcomes were agranulocytosis, liver failure, and birth defects in their offspring. To evaluate the frequency of these side effects associated with the use of ATDs in pregnancy, all live-born pregnancies (n = 830 680), 1996–2008, were identified in a subanalysis.
RESULTS: In the population studied, 28 998 individuals redeemed prescriptions of ATDs (exposure in 2115 pregnancies), which was associated with 45 cases of agranulocytosis (one in pregnancy) and 10 cases of liver failure (one in pregnancy). This corresponded to 41 and 11 cases of agranulocytosis and liver failure per 5 million inhabitants during a 10-year period (agranulocytosis: 0.16\% of ATDs exposed [MMI: 0.11\% vs PTU: 0.27\%, P = .02]; liver failure: 0.03\% of ATDs exposed [MMI: 0.03\% vs PTU: 0.05\%, P = .4]). The majority (83\%) developed the side effect within 3 months of ATD treatment and 25\% during hyperthyroidism relapse. The use of ATDs in pregnancy was associated with birth defects in 3.4\% of exposed children (44 cases per 5 million inhabitants per 10 y), and the frequency of birth defects after ATD exposure was 75 times higher than both maternal agranulocytosis and liver failure in pregnancy.
CONCLUSIONS: In the Danish population in general, ATDs associated birth defects and agranulocytosis had similar frequencies and were more common than liver failure, whereas for the use of ATDs in pregnancy, birth defects were dominant. The burden of side effects to the use of ATDs can be reduced by restricting the use of ATDs in early pregnancy.},

	abstract = {Background
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is generally considered safe in pregnancy for the treatment of rheumatic conditions, but studies have been too small to evaluate teratogenicity. Quantifying the risk of congenital malformations associated with early pregnancy exposure to HCQ is important both in the context of its ongoing use for rheumatological disorders as well as its potential future use for COVID-19 prophylaxis, for which a number of clinical trials are ongoing despite initial trials for COVID-19 treatment having been negative.
Objective
The study objective was to evaluate the risk of major congenital malformations associated with exposure to HCQ during the first trimester, the period of organogenesis.
Study Design
We performed a population-based cohort study nested in the Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX, 2000-2014) and IBM MarketScan Research Database (MarketScan, 2003-2015). The source cohort included 2,045 HCQ exposed and 3,198,589 unexposed pregnancies continuously enrolled in their respective insurance program from 3 months before the last menstrual period through at least one month after delivery; infants were enrolled for at least 3 months after birth. We compared the risk of congenital malformations in women with HCQ use during the first trimester versus no use, restricting the cohort to women with rheumatic disorders and using propensity score matching to control for indication, demographics, medical comorbidities, and concomitant medications (N= 1,867 HCQ exposed; 19,080 unexposed pregnancies). The outcomes considered included major congenital malformations diagnosed during the first 90 days after delivery, and specific malformation types for which there were at least 5 exposed events: oral clefts, cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genital, urinary, musculoskeletal, and limb defects.
Results
Overall, 54.8 per 1,000 infants exposed to HCQ were born with a major congenital malformation versus 35.3 per 1,000 unexposed infants, corresponding to an unadjusted relative risk of 1.51 (95\% CI, 1.27–1.81). Patient characteristics were balanced in the restricted, propensity score matched cohort. The adjusted relative risk was 1.26 (1.04–1.54); it was 1.33 (1.08-1.65) for a daily dose ≥400mg and 0.95 (0.60-1.50) for {\textless}400mg. Among the different malformation groups considered, more substantial increases in the risk for oral clefts, respiratory anomalies and urinary defects were observed, although estimates were imprecise. No pattern of malformations was identified.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest a small increase in the risk of malformations associated with first trimester HCQ use. For most patients with autoimmune rheumatic disorders, the benefits of treatment during pregnancy will likely outweigh this risk. If HCQ were shown to be effective for COVID-19 prophylaxis in ongoing trials, the risk of malformations would need to be balanced against such benefits.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Estimates of the effects of maternal asthma on pregnancy outcomes are inconsistent across studies, possibly because of differences in exposure definition.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes associated with maternal asthma diagnosis, severity, and control in a large, nationally representative cohort.
METHODS: This study was conducted within the IBM Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database (2011-2015) and the Medicaid Analytic eXtract database (2000-2014). Asthma was identified by diagnosis and treatment codes, severity was based on medications dispensed, and control was based on short-acting β-agonist dispensations and exacerbations. We estimated the relative risks (RRs) of stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, and congenital malformations, comparing pregnancies with differing asthma disease status.
RESULTS: We identified 29,882 pregnancies complicated by asthma in the MarketScan database and 160,638 in the Medicaid Analytic eXtract database. We observed no consistent associations between asthma diagnosis, severity, or control, and stillbirth, abortions, or malformations. However, we observed increased risks of prematurity, SGA, and NICU admission among women with asthma compared with those without asthma. Compared with women with well-controlled asthma, women with poor control late in pregnancy had an increased risk of preterm birth (relative risk, 1.39; 95\% CI, 1.32-1.46) and NICU admission (relative risk, 1.26; 95\% CI, 1.17-1.35). More severe asthma was associated with SGA (relative risk, 1.18; 95\% CI, 1.07-1.30).
CONCLUSIONS: We did not observe an increased risk of pregnancy losses or malformations among women with asthma. However, we found an association between asthma severity and SGA, and between exacerbations late in pregnancy and preterm delivery and NICU admission.},

METHODS: Individually linked health data in Denmark (2000-2012), Finland (2005-2014), Iceland (2004-2017), Norway (2005-2015), Sweden (2006-2015), Germany (2006-2015), Australia (New South Wales, 2004-2012), Hong Kong (2001-2015), UK (2006-2016), and the US (Medicaid, 2000-2013, and IBM MarketScan, 2012-2015) were used. Using a uniformed approach, we estimated the prevalence of antipsychotic use as the proportion of pregnancies where a woman filled at least one antipsychotic prescription within three months before pregnancy until birth. For the Nordic countries, data were meta-analyzed to investigate maternal characteristics associated with the use of antipsychotics.
RESULTS: We included 8,394,343 pregnancies. Typical antipsychotic use was highest in the UK (4.4\%) whereas atypical antipsychotic use was highest in the US Medicaid (1.5\%). Atypical antipsychotic use increased over time in most populations, reaching 2\% in Australia (2012) and US Medicaid (2013). In most countries, prochlorperazine was the most commonly used typical antipsychotic and quetiapine the most commonly used atypical antipsychotic. Use of antipsychotics decreased across the trimesters of pregnancy in all populations except Finland. Antipsychotic use was elevated among smokers and those with parity ≥4 in the Nordic countries.
CONCLUSION: Antipsychotic use during pregnancy varied considerably between populations, partly explained by varying use of the typical antipsychotic prochlorperazine, which is often used for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy. Increasing usage of atypical antipsychotics among pregnant women reflects the pattern that was previously reported for the general population.},

            Coarsened exact matching (CEM) is a matching method proposed as an alternative to other techniques commonly used to control confounding. We compared CEM with 3 techniques that have been used in pharmacoepidemiology: propensity score matching, Mahalanobis distance matching, and fine stratification by propensity score (FS). We evaluated confounding control and effect-estimate precision using insurance claims data from the Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly (1999–2002) and Medicaid Analytic eXtract (2000–2007) databases (United States) and from simulated claims-based cohorts. CEM generally achieved the best covariate balance. However, it often led to high bias and low precision of the risk ratio due to extreme losses in study size and numbers of outcomes (i.e., sparse data bias)—especially with larger covariate sets. FS usually was optimal with respect to bias and precision and always created good covariate balance. Propensity score matching usually performed almost as well as FS, especially with higher index exposure prevalence. The performance of Mahalanobis distance matching was relatively poor. These findings suggest that CEM, although it achieves good covariate balance, might not be optimal for large claims-database studies with rich covariate information; it might be ideal if only a few (\&lt;10) strong confounders must be controlled.},

The SSRI-treated group included 316 178 patients in the MAX database (publicly insured; mean [SD] age, 14.7 [2.1] years; 62.2\% female) and 211 460 in the MarketScan database (privately insured; mean [SD] age, 15.8 [2.3] years; 63.9\% female) with at least 2 SSRI prescriptions filled, followed up for a mean (SD) of 2.3 (2.0) and 2.2 (1.9) years, respectively. In publicly insured patients, initiation of SSRI treatment was associated with a 13\% increased hazard of T2DM (intention-to-treat adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.13; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.22) compared with untreated patients. The association strengthened for continuous SSRI treatment (as-treated aHR, 1.33; 95\% CI, 1.21-1.47), corresponding to 6.6 (95\% CI, 4.2-10.4) additional cases of T2D per 10 000 patients treated for at least 2 years.

	abstract = {Purpose To evaluate the use of data from population-based surveys such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for external adjustment for confounders imperfectly measured in health care databases in the United States. Methods Our example study used Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) data to estimate the relative risk (RR) for prenatal serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) exposure and cardiac defects. Smoking and obesity are known confounders poorly captured in databases. NHANES collects information on lifestyle factors, depression, and prescription medications. External adjustment requires information on the prevalence of confounders and their association with SNRI use; which was obtained from the NHANES. It also requires estimates of their association with the outcome, which were based on the literature and allowed us to correct the RR using sensitivity analyses. Results In MAX, the RR for the association between prenatal SNRI exposure and cardiac defects was 1.51 unadjusted and 1.20 adjusted for measured confounders and restricted to women with depression. In NHANES, among women of childbearing age with depression, the prevalence of smoking was 60.2\% (95\% Confidence Interval 43.2, 74.3) for SNRI users and 44.1\% (39.6, 48.8) for nonusers of antidepressants. The corresponding estimates for obesity were 59.2\% (43.2, 74.3) and 40.5\% (35.9, 45.0), respectively. If the associations between smoking and obesity with cardiac defects are independent from each other and from other measured confounders, additional adjustment for smoking and obesity would move the RR from 1.20 to around 1.10. Conclusion National surveys like NHANES are readily available sources of information on potential confounders and they can be used to assess and improve the validity of RR estimates from observational studies missing data on known risk factors.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of adverse maternal and infant outcomes following in utero exposure to duloxetine.
DESIGN: Cohort study nested in the Medicaid Analytic eXtract for 2004-13.
SETTING: Publicly insured pregnancies in the United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women 18 to 55 years of age and their liveborn infants.
INTERVENTIONS: Duloxetine exposure during the etiologically relevant time window, compared with no exposure to duloxetine, exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, exposure to venlafaxine, and exposure to duloxetine before but not during pregnancy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Congenital malformations overall, cardiac malformations, preterm birth, small for gestational age infant, pre-eclampsia, and postpartum hemorrhage.
RESULTS: Cohort sizes ranged from 1.3 to 4.1 million, depending on the outcome. The number of women exposed to duloxetine varied by cohort and exposure contrast and was around 2500-3000 for early pregnancy exposure and 900-950 for late pregnancy exposure. The base risk per 1000 unexposed women was 36.6 (95\% confidence interval 36.3 to 36.9) for congenital malformations overall, 13.7 (13.5 to 13.9) for cardiovascular malformations, 107.8 (107.3 to 108.3) for preterm birth, 20.4 (20.1 to 20.6) for small for gestational age infant, 33.6 (33.3 to 33.9) for pre-eclampsia, and 23.3 (23.1 to 23.4) for postpartum hemorrhage. After adjustment for measured potential confounding variables, all baseline characteristics were well balanced for all exposure contrasts. In propensity score adjusted analyses versus unexposed pregnancies, the relative risk was 1.11 (95\% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.33) for congenital malformations overall and 1.29 (0.99 to 1.68) for cardiovascular malformations. For preterm birth, the relative risk was 1.01 (0.92 to 1.10) for early exposure and 1.19 (1.04 to 1.37) for late exposure. For small for gestational age infants the relative risks were 1.14 (0.92 to 1.41) and 1.20 (0.83 to 1.72) for early and late pregnancy exposure, respectively, and for pre-eclampsia they were 1.12 (0.96 to 1.31) and 1.04 (0.80 to 1.35). The relative risk for postpartum hemorrhage was 1.53 (1.08 to 2.18). Results from sensitivity analyses were generally consistent with the findings from the main analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the evidence available to date, duloxetine is unlikely to be a major teratogen but may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage and a small increased risk of cardiac malformations. While continuing to monitor the safety of duloxetine as data accumulate over time, these potential small increases in risk of relatively uncommon outcomes must be weighed against the benefits of treating depression and pain during pregnancy in a given patient.

In 2014, the overall prevalence of antipsychotic use was highest in Taiwan (78.2/1000 persons), and lowest in Colombia (3.2/1000). In children and adolescents (0–19 years), antipsychotic use ranged from 0.5/1000 (Lithuania) to 30.8/1000 (Taiwan). In adults (20–64 years), the range was 2.8/1000 (Colombia) to 78.9/1000 (publicly insured US population), and in older adults (65+ years), antipsychotic use ranged from 19.0/1000 (Colombia) to 149.0/1000 (Taiwan). Atypical antipsychotic use increased in all populations (range of atypical/typical ratio: 0.7 (Taiwan) to 6.1 (New Zealand, Australia)). Quetiapine, risperidone, and olanzapine were most frequently prescribed. Prevalence and patterns of antipsychotic use varied markedly between countries. In the majority of populations, antipsychotic utilisation and especially the use of atypical antipsychotics increased over time. The high rates of antipsychotic prescriptions in older adults and in youths in some countries merit further investigation and systematic pharmacoepidemiologic monitoring.},

Also, clozapine use is thought to vary by country, but so far no international study has assessed trends in clozapine prescribing. Therefore, this study aimed to assess clozapine use trends on an international scale, using standardised criteria for data analysis. Method A repeated cross-sectional design was applied to data extracts (2005–2014) from 17 countries worldwide. Results In 2014, overall clozapine use prevalence was greatest in Finland (189.2/100 000 persons) and in New Zealand (116.3/100 000), and lowest in the Japanese cohort (0.6/100 000), and in the privately insured US cohort (14.0/100 000). From 2005 to 2014, clozapine use increased in almost all studied countries (relative increase: 7.8–197.2\%). In most countries, clozapine use was highest in 40–59-year-olds (range: 0.6/100 000 (Japan) to 344.8/100 000 (Finland)). In youths (10–19 years), clozapine use was highest in Finland (24.7/100 000) and in the publicly insured US cohort (15.5/100 000). Conclusion While clozapine use has increased in most studied countries over recent years, clozapine is still underutilised in many countries, with clozapine utilisation patterns differing significantly between countries. Future research should address the implementation of interventions designed to facilitate increased clozapine utilisation.},
